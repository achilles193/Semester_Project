So if you wanted to schedule another meeting I can tell you what I've got, and we can see if it works. Yeah? Okay. (Pause) I imagine (pause) times about like this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">towards the end of the day that are best?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Right in the middle of the day would work, too. It's very... I'm just feeling it out. [0:03:00] And I have all these students. And it's not working that well to leave the students at that time of day, but it's not going to last for that long. So (pause) yeah, I will fall into a rhythm, and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">will also feel comfortable telling some people in lab where I'm going. But the summer is not the time to do that, because there's six extra people gone (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I see. (Pause) Let's see.

[0:04:56] I think I just need some variety, beginning or end of the day. I don't know. You shouldn't... we should do Friday at 9:15...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Otherwise you will find yourself going down a hole that you shouldn't worry about. (Pause) [0:06:00] How much about the story of my family, my mom's family, have I told you about?

(Pause) [0:07:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Okay, that doesn't really help me. So my mom's dad is the one who performed our wedding.

I remembered that (inaudible at 0:07:42).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Well, I won't tell you again. So it's... (Pause) [0:08:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: And they're sort of pillars of their community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's this whole scene on the community level and also on the family level. They moved to Columbus in 1973 or something. No, maybe a little later. I don't remember exactly when. And there were, like, 15 families. Kentucky, that area, had just begun desegregating schools. My mom <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">went to a black school that was getting white students bused in. [0:09:02] And there were five of them (inaudible at 0:09:10), one sister, two girls and three boys. And now... so they got there. There were no Italian people. And they started just hosting regular sort of ritualistic...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559879\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: So wait, sorry, about how old was your mom when they moved there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: She was 13.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And why did they move?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: So before that they lived in Africa. That was a very bad time to be in both those countries. [0:09:59] And I think my grandfather's gig was over. He worked for the government. He had gotten his PhD recently. And he worked... I guess he taught for the government.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Huh. Like (pause) what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Science. (Pause) One trend with this side of the family is that... think (ph) the oral tradition of... the oral narrative is... lots of things aren't very specific. So I actually don't know what he did. And I don't think my... if I asked... when I ask my mom she doesn't really tell me anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">(crosstalk). [0:11:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I see. Yeah, I mean, because you were saying your family in (ph) Africa, the government... (chuckling) (inaudible at 0:11:10). Okay, but maybe not to you either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) I don't know. I don't know why... his PhD was this thing that did not fit him at all. He had four kids. He left to... he got his PhD at Carleton. So he had four kids that left in Italy with Nonna (sp?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: To go to Ottawa?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm, for two years. So... and my mom was five or four or something. So he visited once in the... however many years it took him, four or five. [0:11:55] And there's this story of him coming to the airport and the family coming to greet him. And he gives her a big hug, because she's the youngest. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">And she is so upset. She starts crying and crying and crying, she doesn't know who this person is. She's really freaked out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: She's five?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. She might have been four.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Wait, I'm sorry. Again I'm a little confused, because I thought he left to go do the degree when she was four or five.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: I don't remember. I don't know. All of this... this is a great example...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Hazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Of how the facts aren't emphasized, whereas if I were to tell a story of Jeremy's family lineage it would be very fact-heavy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: I follow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: So she... I will find out. [0:12:56] So they moved to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Is this me? It could just be my memory, but I usually tend to remember historical stuff reasonably well? I mean, again it may just be my memory. But I wonder too if I'm picking up something of that... it's harder to remember if the facts don't clearly line up, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: I think so. Well, I don't know if I've told you about these facts before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Those things I don't... the entomology I knew. I think you'd mentioned having been in Africa. Anyway, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: So she was in Africa from eight to thirteen, I think? And I don't know the timing of when he left, when he came back, and when they moved to Africa. But maybe they were in Africa... she was in Africa from five to thirteen. [0:13:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: It also struck me that a five-year-old wouldn't sort of...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559879\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Wouldn't...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Even if she wouldn't have recognized him for not having seen him recently, wouldn't understand what it meant for her father... you know what I mean? (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Okay, she... they moved to Africa when she was five, because I keep hearing mom only lived in Italy for five years. Okay, so most of that time he was gone doing his PhD.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, if she was three maybe she would have been confused, or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, or two. Two or three. She was in Africa for eight years. That makes more sense. (Pause) So she... so they lived with Nonna, and then my grandfather was floundering. He was... he had failed his quals and didn't... wasn't doing well. So my grandmother left her four children and went to Alaska, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">for again I don't know how long. [0:15:03] Two years? And my mom and her siblings were raised by my... Nonna's mom? So Nonna's mom and dad lived in this multi-family compound, a lot of people. And they were the upper, upper, upper class (inaudible at 0:15:33) class also, not wealthy at all. They were <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D2\">poor. I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I see. A lot of status, not much money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. But they knew English, they knew how to write (inaudible at 0:15:49). And they knew the texts and the rituals. [0:16:00] And people worshipped them. So there's a shrine of Nonna's mom that's still there, that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: In the compound or near it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: In the compound, yeah. She had moved out of the compound for the latter part of... the last years of her life just to be with her devotees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: [What is] (ph) the connection between her and you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: My dad's mom. Yeah, I was born on the lunar calendar day that my dad's mom died. People think that she was reincarnated in me. Right. (Pause) (Chuckling) It makes so much sense. [0:16:58] So (pause) then there was a fifth child because the vasectomy didn't work...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Right. Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: (Laughing) Who is Chelsea (sp?). Chelsea is the youngest in... I mean, all five of these people have such strong personalities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: All your mom's siblings and your mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, she's the mildest by far. So I don't know when he was born in this timeline, sometime really soon... right before they went to Africa, I think. So then the older two... (Pause) So then it was schooling. Well, there aren't good schools in Africa. So the older two boys went to Paris. The <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">oldest girl, my mom's sister, still lived in Italy for two more years to continue her schooling. [0:18:02] And then my mom and the youngest went to Africa for the first however many years. And then everybody showed up later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: An incredible amount of turmoil and change for a little kid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: So much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Dad's away. At grandmother's house. Mom goes. You move to Africa, but your siblings take off. You have a new little sibling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Right. (Pause) Yeah. So he was working for the government, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: And a daughter who becomes afraid of separation. I mean, it's just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: [I think] (ph) it's important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's got to be (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: I don't see... (Pause) [0:18:58] I don't see why those things connect. So they had this great life in Africa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Oh. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: I think my mom's way of remembering has the euphoric tint, probably that my way of remembering does, too. So I hear about... they lived in this beautiful government house. And they had servants, and they also had been (ph)... much of the socioeconomic ladder in Italy had servants. It was just, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A51\">the labor is so cheap. So they had servants in Italy, too. But in Africa I think it was... most people didn't have servants.

So they kind of have money in Africa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah, and they would go on vacation to... (Pause) They would go on vacation to various places, which I am now forgetting. Morocco, Turkey, spend time near the Nile. And they would go to the pool club. But they were very conservative, and most people around were Muslim. And my mom went to a Catholic <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">school in Africa. So the -Italy-centricness (sp?) I think was... had been forming. [0:21:02] I mean, obviously it was a huge part, their life in Italy, preserving their class and their status and their role. But then moving to Africa I think it was all the more strengthened. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Huh. Although your grandfather also chose to do things that took him very far away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Education seemed to be more important than anything. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Although I'm sure he could have done stuff... I mean, he could have done... I mean, maybe not for the schooling... [0:22:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: No, you can't get a... he wasn't smart enough, I think, to go to the top ranked school in Italy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: My dad did. And he was able to get a full ride for his PhD in the US, which no one... it's very hard. So there... I don't know what it was that took him so far away. I wouldn't be surprised also if what you're getting at is... he wanted to be far away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there was some kind of tension.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: That makes sense to me, knowing him. (Pause) [0:22:58] But he did so poorly out there. The way he tells it, he really needed Nonna (inaudible at 0:23:08). (Pause) She has something... PhD stands for (pause) Push Husband... (Pause) Maybe she says it's PHT, Push Husband Through? Anyway, she says <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">my mom played that role for my dad, too. (Pause) [0:24:00] He says he was depressed and out of sorts maybe for the only time in his life during his PhD. My mom was a very (inaudible at 0:24:14). (Pause) So they make this big decision to move to the US, and the reason cited is, the kids aren't smart <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B92\">enough to all go to the best schools in Italy, because I think his job was over, and they had to move. Or it was getting too violent. So going to America was the only way to educate five children and have them all be able to get good jobs. [0:24:56] So all five of them went to Penn State. And they showed <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B93\">up. Nonna didn't have a job for a while. They knew one family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Sorry, I have one more question. So why would it have been so crucial for them to go to the best schools in Italy if they had gone back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Because their life wouldn't have been very good otherwise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: There's a bigger difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: I think they wanted them... they wanted the best possible life in the whole world for their children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: And that was going to be in America.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: But the way to get to America is to do really well at the top school in Italy and go later, like my dad did, or (pause) emigrate. [0:26:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: As another route.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559879\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Different from your dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Right. I think that's a good question, though. I may find out more. (Pause) So that was a very hard time. Nonna worked. My mom was teased. She didn't fit in. She was kind of fat. (Pause) Yeah, it's not the South, but it was the South. It was more the South back then than it is now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Sure. [0:26:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: So had this pretty intense nucleation of this warm, loving immigrant family that hosted every other Italian immigrant that came to that area. So my dad was one of them. He stayed with them when he first got to the country. My mom was 17 or something at that time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Oh. And how old was he (inaudible at 0:27:33?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: 20. [I think actually] (ph) he was 21. And they got married when he was... I don't know. 30? 29? And there was a seven year difference, five, seven years, which is something Jeremy can't believe, that I don't know their ages or what year they were born or what year they were married or how far <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">apart they are. [0:28:08] Every time I ask I forget. (Pause) He was born in 1953. That I have remembered for a while. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, didn't he just turn 60?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [It was easy] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) When you just wrote him this (inaudible at 0:28:38) speech?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: She was born... she might have been born in 1958. Turning 55 maybe? [0:28:56] So that means that she would have been 16, like I said, when he came. And he was 21. (Pause) Fast forward, they built this church. It's expanded to this 2,000-person hall. And their membership is about 1,200 families, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E11\">which means those people pay every year? So that's 4,000 or 5,000 people who are affiliated with members. And then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: It's a pretty big congregation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: And then apparently 5,000 more people will just come. (Pause) [0:29:55] But it's not very organized. People just come when they want to for anything. And... have you been to a Hindu temple? (Pause) Very free, very freeing and free. So the word congregation feels wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: But I don't know what it would be. Also you don't have to... there's no such thing as converting. Many people come who aren't religious who just want to be part of the community, because they're Italian. Some people come who feel like they are who aren't Italian. [0:30:57] So they started by <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E91\">doing these weekly reading some text, some (pause) parable? What's a type of story that teaches you a lesson?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, a parable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: It's parabolic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: That's different, but yeah. (inaudible at 0:31:28) parabola, though. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: There are a couple parables that get... that are auspicious to read. And you... the lesson are about telling the truth and remembering to eat the offering as a blessing to yourself, and keeping your promises, and this and that. [0:32:02] So this is what we did this weekend. We went there to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F11\">celebrate our first anniversary with them. (Pause) It was really important to me, because I missed this the day after my wedding. So this... (Pause). And it's often done when people want to give thanks. [0:32:58] So this was done the day after my wedding. So I felt... it felt pretty shitty to miss it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F12\">so that day I was like, we will go next year. But it's very hard to get personal attention in Columbus, because two of the siblings live there, Chelsea, the youngest, and the oldest girl. I call her Jacqueline (sp?). They live there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559879\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: She's the oldest sibling, or the second oldest?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: She's the second oldest. And Nonna and Nana (sp?) have this huge network of people that they counsel. Nonna still performs (inaudible at 0:33:46), and then Nana does two a day on weekends sometimes. And it's just a big family. [0:33:59] And everybody is really close. So Jacqueline's husband <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F51\">Joey (sp?) is turning 65. So he also wanted to do a ceremony. And then, when my brother heard that we were arriving on his birthday which was Friday, we sort of tried to get him to come, and he did. So he had his own. He also wanted to do a ceremony. Or it was like, you should do a ceremony for your <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F52\">birthday. So we didn't really have our own thing at all. But Chelsea's children were also there, and Jacqueline and Joey's children and their spouses. And one of them has two children also. So there are five children that Nonna and Nana (sp?) have. [0:34:59] Each one has a boy and a girl.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Each of...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: Five children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Okay, right, so they have ten grandkids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: There's ten grandkids. And then the oldest grandkid has two boys. The oldest grandkid (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">THERAPIST: They have two great-grandkids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. So all their grandkids and great-grandkids were there except four. So it ended up being that all the grandkids are going to perform the puja. And they invited 60 people, which means that it was in the small room, for Joey's 65th birthday. And it's a big year for him, because he is a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201011\">VP, and he is retiring. (Pause) [0:36:00] (Chuckling) How's it going?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Okay. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: So I noticed a lot of things for the first time this visit. All ten grandchildren and five children and Nonna, Nana get together twice a year for a week at a time until I was 22. So we never missed a year. [0:36:57] And this is the family gathering that has brought to the surface historically <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201051\">or provoked the most memorable and profound sadness for me. (Pause) Not anymore. I'm pretty... it's fine for me now for somebody to leave (ph). (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: When did that change?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: Well, we sort of stopped the super-regular routine of a beach week in the summer...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: When you were 22, uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: And of Christmas week in December. The beach thing sort of stopped earlier. The Christmas thing is still going, but I spent that week with Jeremy's family last year. [0:38:00] I think it stopped (pause) probably when I got to college. A lot of it had to do with Claire (sp?), the oldest grandchild, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D1\">who has two sons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, your mom's oldest brother?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: My mom's... actually her sister. So the sister had children... got married and had children first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">CLIENT: Then (inaudible at 0:38:32). (Pause) But yeah, there were... from age zero until maybe fourteen, I would just cry and cry and cry, cry the last day, cry in the car, cry at home. [0:39:00] (Pause) (Chuckling) And still my dad asked me if I was sad yesterday, which was really nice, I think because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201151\">I sounded sad. But I was just tired. And he was like, yeah, even though you were sad so much, all the time, sad every time, it never really lasted for that long (pause) which I think is true, because I think that was what they paid attention to. (Pause) This is part of her (ph) separation (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201152\">at 0:39:51). (Pause) [0:40:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20114-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20114-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559879\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">So, if you want to spend any time with Nonna and Nana when other people aren't around or when the phone isn't ringing, you have to show up from 6:30 to 7:30 in the morning. That was what Jeremy and I did on Saturday morning. And these days they're the happiest people in the world to split a medium coffee. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201171\">(Pause) [0:40:59] But it's this big group effort. It's like, even when we're trying to see them alone, people hear (ph) (inaudible at 0:41:09) mama means mother's brother. Larry (sp?) mama heard us talking. He was like, well, I know it's painful. But this is what I do to get time with them. I show up <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201172\">at 6:30. I show up with a coffee. And this is where the coffee shop is. And they like two creams, and this and that. And it's like... other people are like, you're going to do that, wake up at 6:30? It's... and there's a lot of sort of... so much laughing and drinking and sitting around and talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201173\">until very late at night. [0:41:55] So we left early and went to bed at 1:00 on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">But yeah, we did it, and it was so lovely to spend time with them. They are... (Pause) They are so amazing. Nonna especially. Nana sort of gives off this... well, I don't know. I think he's... (Pause) He's feeling a lot of darkness or experiencing a lot of darkness in his later life. I think his personality <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201191\">is just more volatile. But we were talking about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: It's about the end, but go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: We were talking about meditation and actually (inaudible at 0:42:58) I guess. [0:43:01] And she clearly (pause) has a lot of it, even though she's this super loud, very dynamic sort of planner-coordinator, didactic, very loving grandmotherly, motherly. She's very even in terms of her... the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D1\">way she relates to the world, I think. So I asked her, when did you notice this, or when did you acquire this, start to acquire? And first she said, it's from her mother. Then she said, oh, when I was four... she had two answers. When she was... it started when she was four. And then her other answer <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D2\">is, well, it started in her past life. [0:44:00] (Pause) I guess that's all [I'll say] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Okay. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">CLIENT: It's a very intense scene.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:44:40). (Pause) Yeah, we should stop. [0:44:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">CLIENT: So unsatisfying. There's so much to say. (Pause) See you Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">THERAPIST: See you then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
