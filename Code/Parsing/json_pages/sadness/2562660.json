Come on in!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Good morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Morning!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">(pause 00:00:26 to 00:00:59)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Did you know you were pregnant when you got engaged?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: What brought that question to mind? Is it something you\u2019d been thinking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, so, so... I\u2019m very happy for you. I left and I was thinking about it. It occurred to me that I hadn\u2019t asked my usual question of like, \u201cWas this intentional?\u201d But... the timing was different from how some people... order their lives. So... it occurred to me that... that this might have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">been an experience that was not... planned and... as a result, might have involved some suffering, on your part. So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Hmm! How?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: (pause) Well, remembering that I know nothing about your relationship, one could imagine that you... would have a decision to make... and that that would not be an easy one. (pause) So I... you know, I can count okay, so... I was pretty sure of the answer to the question before I asked it, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">I thought it was important to talk about, because it seemed like, it seemed like it says a lot about me. I was also interested in you, and wanted to express my interest in your life and... You know, I think it (chuckles) it says a lot that my initial response was just like, very positive, because that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">not always my initial response. I also tend to ascribe to you, I think, the highest possible intentionality. So... Not that it\u2019s troubling for me in any way if you like, are not the ideal person. Just that like, as a default assumption, you get the ideal values. So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: And how would this be less than ideal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Um, I... (chuckles) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m... I\u2019m seriously trying to just follow how you\u2019re thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Well, so, so the... (pause) In the abstract sense (not talking specifically about your relationship), often pregnancies that then result in engagements were not planned. That... situation leads to choices that people may or may not have made otherwise. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Not at my age! (client affirms) Pregnancies do not happen at my age! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Okay. (pause) Well, again, congratulations! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Thank you. (pause) So you\u2019re thinking people don\u2019t try to get pregnant if they\u2019re not married.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Um... (chuckles) Many people don\u2019t try to get pregnant if they\u2019re not married. Again, that doesn\u2019t say anything about... your specific circumstances, I think, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Maybe. I\u2019m not sure that, but... okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Well, so there is this sort of like a distribution of behaviors in the world, right? So, knowing that, knowing the sequence of events doesn\u2019t tell me anything about... other than you fall in some distribution of behavior, but you could fall at either tail, so... It\u2019s less likely, but that doesn\u2019t... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">I also have no idea how old you are, so I (chuckles)... Your response is an amusing one, in some ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s just like that, but... I know you\u2019re older than I am, but I... That\u2019s like... That doesn\u2019t bound things very much. I know you\u2019re not 80, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: But it sounds like... the thought process was, your immediate response was congratulations, you were very happy. And then you thought about it after, and tried to sort of fit these timelines into things that felt familiar to you, that you know, and then started to kind of wonder, maybe even <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">worry a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562660\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Yeah, that\u2019s almost exactly right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">(pause 00:06:35 to 00:07:56)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">Yeah, and then part of the worry, I think, is... you know... are you okay? I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re okay, because you, or at least that you will tell me that you are, because I\u2019m not really your support network, so... nor should I be, probably. But... (pause) But also like... my response does not like... <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">necessarily take into account your... feelings or circumstances in the matter. So... Yeah. It would not necessarily be the case that you were wholly happy about... where your life is at the moment, and so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Which could be true, whether I were married first or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Absolutely, absolutely. But (chuckles), but again, I sort of ascribe to you very high intentionality, so it\u2019s sort of like, that, not that... Yeah. So I think it was sort of a recognition that my implicit assumptions were not necessarily valid, that I wasn\u2019t even aware of them. That was the... so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: But then just the different set of implicit assumptions just kicked in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Um... (sighs) No. They\u2019re much more explicit at that point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: A different set of assumptions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I was aware of them, and as a result, aware that they had no (chuckles) particular... I try to be very careful in phrasing this, because like, I really don\u2019t know anything about, other than, like... So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Well, it seems like it\u2019s sort of, this is about what it\u2019s like, operating with not a lot of information. You know, trying to fill in what things could mean for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that\u2019s true, too. Yeah, absolutely. You know, on the other hand, there is a wealth of information here, you know. It explains why you\u2019ve stopped drinking coffee, so... But yes, I think that is right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">(pause 00:11:29 to 00:12:33)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">So I wondered how uncomfortable this is for you, this conversation has been?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Well, not really. (client affirms) What was your concern in terms of that? Like, how would I feel uncomfortable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Um... (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Because the questions are personal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, we\u2019re talking about a very personal set of questions. (pause) And also, I have been uncomfortable in talking about it and so I... I think I have, as a result, wondered whether you might be uncomfortable also. Mostly, I think because I\u2019m uncomfortable, because I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">going to like... It doesn\u2019t make sense, or that I\u2019m going to run into something that will upset you. (pause) Which doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, because I, I actually trust you to be able to deal with your emotions like, I really do. So... (pause) Again, I think that says a lot about where I am, at present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">(pause 00:14:11 to 00:15:10)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: I was thinking that, when you refer to the minister, who married you and Tanya, that that first question you asked was whether it was planned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. (pause) Yes. It didn\u2019t even occur to me that, when you told me you were pregnant, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">(pause 00:15:38 to 00:16:00)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">Yeah, so I also said last week that my sister was 32 weeks pregnant, so like, you were just starting to show a little bit. So I was sort of wondering like, how far along might you be, as I was walking back to my apartment, which was the point at which I said, \u201cHmm... the timeline is different from what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">I would have expected.\u201d So... different from what I would have expected, given the assumptions that... you act only intentionally, which obviously is an absurd assumption about any human. And... that you were following some normal course of life events, which is... has no particular validity, necessarily. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200672\">Anyway, but that led to the question and all. So the oh, how interesting that it didn\u2019t occur to me to wonder that at all, neither at the beginning or at the end. I was just happy for you. I think that\u2019s because I really like you, and I think you would be a fantastic mother and I think it\u2019s, I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200673\">it\u2019s great. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562660\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: And, so you know, assuming that this is what you wanted, I just thought you must be happy, and so I was also very happy for you. I think there is also like... (pause) I certainly think I have a desire for children, in a general sense. Here is this thing that I want and you have that is, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">that\u2019s great! I want you to have good things, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: (pause) Well, and I was thinking in terms of comparing me to your sister. She is someone who, at least from what you last said, is in not a good situation, in some ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah (chuckles), that\u2019s definitely true. (pause) Somehow, that doesn\u2019t seem particularly important to me, in this context, but maybe it is important and I just don\u2019t... recognize it as such. (pause) I mean, you\u2019re very different people, but also like, the particular trouble she is in is that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">she\u2019s getting divorced while pregnant, not that she\u2019s getting engaged or married while she was pregnant, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">(pause 00:19:42 to 00:21:33)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sort of thinking about... I wasn\u2019t really sure where else to go on this topic. You had sort of... you had mentioned reasoning in the face of not having very much information. You know, certainly you\u2019ve seen some elements of how I reasoned without very much information, which is a situation <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">I\u2019m often in, professionally. It\u2019s just, what we do is we collect data and then try to figure out what the next thing to collect is, and what might be going on, and so forth, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">There is a sense in which I\u2019m comfortable with... that. There is also a sense in which one the reasons that I like experimental science is that... for the most part, one can query without... There are usually financial and temporal costs associated with it, but... (inaudible) ever needs to be known, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">then you go find it out and then have the answers. There is something nice about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">(pause 00:23:00 to 00:23:39)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">One of the places I thought this conversation might go... but that it hasn\u2019t exactly... We talked several weeks ago, at the end of a session, about like, sensitivity to other people or something like that. I forget exactly how you phrased it. So, I thought there were elements of that in this, and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">might lead us in that direction again, but... I don\u2019t have anything to say on it, it\u2019s just like, anything that I thought might come up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">(pause 00:24:12 to 00:24:41)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562660\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Does my being pregnant make you think more about your wish for children? You had mentioned that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">(pause 00:24:49 to 00:25:29)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: (chuckles) I am not actually sure how to answer that. Yes? No? (chuckles) I have thought about it, as a result... But I think about it occasionally, anyway. And I might otherwise have thought about it in the context of Tanya being acutely unwell, because... it really does not seem like... (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">It does not seem like that\u2019s a desire that will be fulfilled in the near term. Or something like that. (pause) So, in response to your sort of causal question, I have no idea, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">(pause 00:26:45 to 00:29:24)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">So, entirely unrelatedly, I\u2019m very sad. It\u2019s been a trying week. Again, unrelatedly, but... So Tanya\u2019s father came to visit this weekend, which was... well intentioned, but made her very anxious, in part because they\u2019re unable to make reasonable travel plans on a reasonable schedule. So it was still <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">like, they were still making travel plans on Thursday and they came on Friday, so... By then, Tanya was already anxious about feeling like she had to help with the planning and figure things out and didn\u2019t want to do that. She had just... done her three days of nannying (ph) right after getting out <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200872\">of the hospital, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">She had mostly cleared her weekend schedule, so that she could have time to recover, and then had to deal with the emotional turmoil caused by dealing with her father. It was also a good visit like, once he was here. I think it was very good for her, but... (pause) It was complicated by some... Tanya <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">had also agreed to dog-sit for a friend. Several... I don\u2019t know, a month or more ago, and so she did that also. So they (chuckles) they all stayed at... her brother came up also. They also stayed at her friend\u2019s apartment, which... was fine. For me, that\u2019s very weird, but it\u2019s fine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: \u201cFor me is very weird,\u201d meaning that you think it\u2019s strange that they did that, or... for you that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. It was just a strange thing to do. \u201cOh, you\u2019re dog sitting for someone. Well, we\u2019ll just come stay with you in someone else\u2019s house,\u201d like... Tanya\u2019s immediate response was, \u201cWell, I have to ask the person whose house it is whether that\u2019s okay, but, yeah, I guess we can do that.\u201d So it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">was okay with... that person, but, still just, for me, a very strange thing. I see it as equivalent to inviting yourself to someone\u2019s house that you don\u2019t know. At least the way I was raised, there were some social norms against doing that sort of thing, but I was raised in a weird place, so... who knows?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">But that was also... I guess, in the other sense of... your question, that you were asking me about, it was trying for me, in the sense that I didn\u2019t go stay with them, because that seemed like a nightmare. But... there was, so like, Friday night, before they got in, and Sunday after they left, Tanya <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">stayed down there. I knew Tanya was really not doing well, so her being alone was anxiety inducing for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">(pause 00:33:04 to 00:33:44)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">Yeah, there is a sense in which I knew this was coming (sighs) a week before it happened, because... her father had e-mailed while she was in the hospital and said, \u201cYou know, I would like to come up and visit you. Is that okay?\u201d Tanya said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019d love to see you. Why don\u2019t you come up after I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">get out?\u201d Because... she apparently has no ability to project herself into the future, and think about what her emotional state will be, and the impact of her father visiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562660\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: Because if she did, she would be less likely to have him come?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah! Yeah! (chuckles) If she had been able to... get... like, a quarter of... what it was going to be like, in her head, when she was replying to that e-mail, she would have said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in a month or something. Or never.\u201d But I actually think it\u2019s good that he did come visit. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">I think that\u2019s a good thing. I think it was poorly timed, and poorly planned, and caused a lot of stress, and it didn\u2019t relieve a lot of stress. So that seems like the opposite of the point, when you\u2019re trying to visit your daughter, who just got out of the hospital for mental illness. So... (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200972\">But ultimately, it comes down to he needed to see her. That\u2019s why he came up. He needed to feel like he was taking care of her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: Are you annoyed at him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Was I? (therapist affirms) Or am I?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Both. (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: I sure seem like I am, don\u2019t I? (therapist affirms) (pause) Yeah, I think I was. Yeah. But, you know, this is the sort of, this was just (chuckles) how they exist in the world, as a family unit, so like, there is some resignation to that also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">(pause 00:35:58 to 00:36:50)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">Yeah, at the end of the day, I can deal with annoyance... (pause) It\u2019s less clear to me how to deal with Tanya\u2019s inability to deal with anxiety or stress or pick a word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">(pause 00:37:17 to 00:38:40)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">Yeah, I don\u2019t know what to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: (pause) Less clear how to deal with it, because it\u2019s so unpleasant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s unpleasant. There is nothing really I can do to escape it. I... it\u2019s acute for a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">(pause 00:39:24 to 00:40:08)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">It\u2019s packed with uncertainty. It seems like I might have some control or influence, but I don\u2019t actually. So it leaves me in this position of feeling like, \u201cWell, if I had just, you know, am a little more supportive, it will get better,\u201d when in fact, how supportive I am is almost irrelevant to whether <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">it gets better or worse. My actions are, mean very little, but I mean, it\u2019s very easy to continue to do more and more, with essentially no payoff, which itself like... presents it, if the things I do don\u2019t matter, which I know is what I just said, but I mean, don\u2019t matter in, I guess, some other sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">(pause) I\u2019m not sure there is another sense, though. That\u2019s interesting. So... Yeah. Trying to influence things that are not actually... things that I can influence makes me feel powerless. Who would have thought? (pause) But then there is the uncertainty again, right? Because some of the things I do <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B11\">actually matter, but... I have no idea which they will be, on any given day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">(pause 00:41:47 to 00:43:30)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">What are you thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I was going back to what you started with, in talking about sort of seeing me as someone who is intentional, and then worrying about circumstances being not ideal. I just started thinking about ideal in particular. You know, what it means to deal with not ideal situations and view it like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">\u201cI feel fine with that.\u201d And how... well, probably, by definition all situations are not ideal, since ideal is not in reality. But I just, yeah, I started to think about that, different circumstances under which people actual (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562660\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">(pause 00:44:17 to 00:44:51)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">And I just thought about circumstances that you want to have to deal with and then the circumstances that you actually have to deal with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Do you mean me, or the generalized you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: You... both, I think. (pause) All this, just various friends and so forth going through \u201cnot ideal\u201d situations that have turned out really nicely for them. I mean, if the certain parameters were not as they would have set them up. (pause) And so maybe it\u2019s about flexibility, not quite flexibility, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">but something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: So that makes sense, and, you know, I started, had a few hackles raised towards the end of what you were saying, because there is a sort of interpretation in which I could read you as saying like, \u201cWell, you should just be okay with where your life is right now.\u201d (therapist denies) \u201cIt will <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">be okay,\u201d which... (chuckles) Thank you for clarifying, but I didn\u2019t really...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: No, I wasn\u2019t saying that at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t really think that, that you were. I think it\u2019s interesting in the context I was talking about. I can deal with Tanya\u2019s father coming to visit, and her family\u2019s (chuckles) strange circumstances. You know, I bitch about a little bit to you, or to my other more intentional friends, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">like I can deal with it just fine. I actually like seeing them. But I really don\u2019t know how to deal with this, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Even though I said, I want to, I realize we\u2019ve run out of time (client affirms), but, and I won\u2019t, and of course, I can\u2019t (inaudible) to say, but I definitely did not, that was not what I was thinking about at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: But let\u2019s pick this up next week, okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Okay.
