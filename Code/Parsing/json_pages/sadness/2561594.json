data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Good, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Did you have a good holiday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I did thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I\u2019m still not used to this [inaudible] arrangement. (pause) I\u2019ve been staying at my place mostly. I guess I\u2019m not happy but peaceful about that. I don\u2019t know how to describe it, but it feels peaceful, like I have a place to go to. [00:04:03.04] It\u2019s dirty and I\u2019ve cleaned it. I cleaned other <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">people\u2019s shit quickly, but it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not going to make a big deal out of it. But it feels I have somewhat of a little point. It doesn\u2019t feel centered yet but I think the more time I spend on it the more it will feel like a center. It\u2019s like I think of it and it calms me. I mean I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">go back there and I can be by myself and I can shut the door and I can light my candle and I can make a cup of tea and look at my books. [00:05:03.15] I may not open and read them but I can look at them. I haven\u2019t been to Chris\u2019s place in a long time. Well, probably a week, two weeks. Mostly I\u2019m thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">of Nelson. [ph] And another friend of mine who was applying to a PhD program and I\u2019ve been helping him every day. And I just I haven\u2019t thought about this much but he has a masters in creative writing. Now he\u2019s [inaudible] PhD and I\u2019m like and everyone\u2019s like no, [inaudible] MA first because it\u2019s a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">big switch. He\u2019s like no, I already have an MA. I\u2019m going for a PhD. And then he\u2019s like why don\u2019t you apply to one. You should have. What else does your you have three masters and what is this. And I just felt very this is a symbol of my life, or not my life but the way that I feel about myself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200175\">I feel like I\u2019m stuck at that level of education, a masters. I don\u2019t believe in myself and that I have what it takes to do a PhD. [00:07:02.25] But also I feel like I\u2019m not ready right now. Maybe next year. But that really until now I feel like that really wasn\u2019t the dichotomy in my head, that I [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200176\">person. I have small capabilities. PhD people are robust and intellectual and hard working. People like Chris get a PhD. His friends, they have PhDs. Who am I to even think that I can try.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Why do you want a PhD?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: No it\u2019s just like I\u2019m just thinking. Because I don\u2019t he wants a PhD for teaching, I guess, and he\u2019s like why do you keep wanting one masters after another. Go for a PhD. So we\u2019re just thinking in terms of capitalizing on the education we have if we want to be in the field of education. [00:08:07.06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: But you want to write.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Mm-hm. Yeah, I do. But that\u2019ll he wants to write, too, but a PhD in teaching is going to be his fallback. I do not know what my fallback is. Yeah, I mean I was ready to defend myself. I was like no, I want to write. I\u2019m confident in that. I don\u2019t have a fallback right now, and that\u2019s okay. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">This year and the past couple years I\u2019ve been focusing on one project, and I want to get it done and then think about other stuff. But I do feel confident. I mean I believe in what I\u2019m saying to him. [00:09:02.23] But then sometimes it does make me nervous and [inaudible] Maybe because I\u2019m scared to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">apply for PhDs. But me helping him is kind of helping me to think about making me think I can do it too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561594\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: Why not get a medical degree?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s not about just getting degrees, it\u2019s more about feeling confident.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I understand, but then you start translating it into sort of categories that don\u2019t necessarily make a lot of sense for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: You want to write, you [inaudible] PhD to write a disserta I mean you won\u2019t be able to do your writing. You might as well just get get a medical degree then. [00:10:05.08] I mean just go get a go to law school. Why aren\u2019t you going to law school? Look at all these successful lawyers. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">You\u2019re not going to law school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I do beat myself up about that. Yesterday someone was talking about getting their finance PhD and now they\u2019re working at with the FCC. [ph] I\u2019m like wow, that\u2019s so smart. I feel so dumb. I\u2019m wasting my life. And then it\u2019s just like I\u2019m going to have to face such people in the room, obviously, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">that it\u2019s close to hell. [ph] It was I have to work on this and talk to other writers and how they deal with this anxiety, this insecurity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think this has anything to do with writing. [00:11:02.03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Really? What does it have to do with?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: It has to do with you, how you feel about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: I thought I was working on this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: You are. I think you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m staying at my place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: It wasn\u2019t meant as a criticism Cecelia [ph]. I was commenting more on your saying well maybe if I talk to other writers I can get some it sounds like you get some pointers on how you deal with insecurity and that\u2019s why I was saying that I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with being a writer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It has to do with how I see myself. [00:12:23.24] (pause) I think I\u2019m working on that. I realize that if I don\u2019t write every day I feel bad, and I try and write every day. And once I do that I have a better image of myself, trying not to trying to be there for other people. [00:13:19.00] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">That makes me feel useful when I try and do that. I\u2019m trying not to lean on people too much. I don\u2019t know what else to do. I mean (pause) I think I feel so ashamed by my mom. I guess that was one of the things that was bothering me. [00:14:05.12] But you know what you said earlier, that instead of me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">thinking oh, she\u2019s working on [inaudible] so she\u2019s just lazy, I have to [inaudible] oh God or lonely or whatever. That\u2019s I\u2019m trying to think more in those terms that yeah, she shouldn\u2019t have her teaching [inaudible] but she didn\u2019t take that [ph]because that was too much work and she just wanted to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B3\">be like this place is close to her house and she can just walk. [ph]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Did she ever offer to teach?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it wasn\u2019t going to pay very much and it was going to be a lot of work so and she was like no, I have to work on my thesis and all that. So I don\u2019t want to do that. [00:15:02.13] But in January she\u2019ll start teaching so we\u2019ll see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Really? She got a job?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Well it\u2019s like student teaching so we don\u2019t know how much it will pay, but all of her coursework has been leading up to this, I think, so (pause) I feel like starting all over, starting a new life. [00:17:24.21] Living with my parents and not seeing Chris and his friends. And hanging out with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">Nelson [ph] instead. It\u2019s very different. I feel sad and excited at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561594\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Can you tell me about both? [00:18:03.14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Sad because I feel like I miss Chris. I feel guilty. And excited because I really like spending time with Nelson. [ph] He\u2019s got a lot of energy and I feel like I have a lot of energy. In some ways, I don\u2019t even think about this that much, but I feel like that\u2019s the kind of relationship that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">I always wanted but I didn\u2019t really have it until now. But now I feel like it\u2019s too late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Too late for what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: I feel like this should have happened in my 20s, early 20s, so I could\u2019ve got it out of my system and [inaudible] It\u2019s like Chris was is beautiful, like his thoughts and the fact that he wants to change the world, his ideals and his ability to be to empathize. [00:19:18.20] He\u2019s just got <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">a very beautiful heart. And I miss that. And I was the one who could see it and appreciate it and bring it out more and more. Like talking to him you wouldn\u2019t necessarily think that. I mean you would respect him but that would be that. But I feel like because I was in a relationship with him I was able <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">to see that soft part of him and bring it out more. And that\u2019s what we shared, things that he saw that I, too, found beautiful, the way that he could empathize with people who don\u2019t have enough or so I feel like his life has a higher purpose and I kind of oriented my life towards that, that I, too, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B3\">shall have a higher purpose. I felt lofty and good about it until I fell, until things went wrong, until I was like this is not happening, he\u2019s got his life all figured out and I don\u2019t. I have [inaudible] he has everything and I don\u2019t. It just got destructive and I [inaudible] relationships. [00:21:07.07] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B4\">But I mean I feel like that\u2019s the matter [ph] I\u2019m taking. But I could also take another matter [ph] that would be. That it works mutually not working out, like he\u2019s done a few things, I\u2019ve done a few things, but I just take all the blame, I feel. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s accurate or whatever but that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B5\">how I feel. I mean I feel like I\u2019m happier with Nelson, [ph] but I\u2019m like that\u2019s just so shallow. It\u2019s not that shallow but I feel like in comparison. [00:22:03.29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure I understand the shallow part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Well, mostly just like physical and talking about feelings and emotions and people and life and other things. But I guess it\u2019s not that shallow. No, it\u2019s not that shallow. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s not Chris. I feel like I\u2019m realizing now how much I love him. But it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know that I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">do anything about it. I feel like I [inaudible] now at least. (pause) But I feel calm because I\u2019m not running back and forth, so that\u2019s nice. [00:23:24.06] Well that\u2019s only because Nelson [ph] is in town and so this is where it takes [inaudible] I can be seeing more of Chris [inaudible] staying over <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">at his place. (yawn) I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you\u2019re seeing more less of Chris just because Nelson [ph] is around more?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: (pause) I mean there\u2019s beauty in everyone and you see it but what do you do with it? And it changes so it\u2019s dynamic. I mean it\u2019s like I\u2019m looking at two paintings and they\u2019re both differently beautiful. Depending on who you ask they would say one is more beautiful than the other. Which one do <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">you love more? Which one do you take home? So I don\u2019t know. I feel like I\u2019m ignoring my own the [inaudible] painting that I am or I\u2019m making. [00:27:02.11] So I feel like I cannot answer that question until I look at my own stuff, myself, and work on myself first.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561594\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: Why do you think you\u2019re looking at the other paintings before yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: It\u2019s easier. It\u2019s just the way that our bodies are structured. You can\u2019t really look at yourself. Even like these holidays I had grand plans of just working on my book and not doing anything else, but then my friend is like no, [inaudible] help me. So I have to see him every day and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: Why do you have to see him? I don\u2019t understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Well because we\u2019re working on his application. His English is not that good. [00:28:02.11] His typing\u2019s kind of slow. So I\u2019m ending up doing a lot of stuff for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Well why do you have to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, just because.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: You have your own things you need to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: So why do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I was going to try to set boundaries. I\u2019m like okay, we\u2019ll meet at three but not before so I can [inaudible] a few hours to myself.

I want people to lean on me, depend on me. It makes me feel useful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: I was thinking you\u2019re sounding like your mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: How?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: I mean that he would ask you to do all this work for him for no particular exchange, or just sort of for your own to sacrifice your own time. [00:30:11.17] And then when you started talking about how you hope he\u2019ll feel toward you and it really sounded like your mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: How she hopes that I feel that for her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: No, that you want her to feel that way, that you need to feel needed and feel like you have a place. That\u2019s how you\u2019ve spoken about her, about how you want to feel with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: It gives my days some structure and yeah, I do have this need to feel needed, wanted. [00:31:04.11] I don\u2019t know if that makes me emotionally weak or whatever. Yeah, not so scary that I sound like my mom. It\u2019s okay. She\u2019s not that bad. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking? [00:32:14.01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just unhappy about or actually scared that I\u2019m ruining the chance I have. [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Ruining how?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Because I am helping him write his essay and a couple of paragraphs on my own. Like I want him to [inaudible] research question. And [inaudible] feel bad. I don\u2019t know if that sounds important or not. Because that\u2019s not his own except I mean I did force him to talk to [inaudible] (pause) felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">the same way about when Chris was helping my mom with her thesis. [00:33:37.01] [inaudible] a lot of work to do [inaudible] when someone else is depending on you you want to do an even better job because you don\u2019t want to let them down or you don\u2019t want them to suffer or fail because of your help.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561594\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: Well if you\u2019re worried about that, why not let him do it on his own? [00:34:05.00] If you think he\u2019ll do better on his own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Well, I don\u2019t think he would. They had some sample essays and they were very strong [inaudible] very generic [inaudible] more specific I think. (pause) And you know I\u2019m getting his friendship in return. [00:35:05.15] He\u2019s like yeah, you\u2019re my best friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Is it a friendship you could only get by doing something for him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean that\u2019s how it started. I was helping him last year with his thesis. So he got an A on his thesis. So I don\u2019t know, I guess our relationship is based on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: It sounds like buying a friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: I feel like I\u2019m not very lucky in that regard so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: Friends?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t feel like you have any friends?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: I just feel that way a lot. I mean I know I do but then they don\u2019t [inaudible] (pause) But I don\u2019t feel like I have a knack of just making [ph] friends for friends. [00:36:28.25] [inaudible] It really shakes my confidence when people don\u2019t invite me or don\u2019t respond to an e-mail or whatever, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">or come to me. I was hanging out with this one girl, I\u2019ve known her for a while, and a few weeks ago I went over to her place for brunch. And we were both like yeah, this is so much fun. [00:37:06.26] You and I are kind of struggling with the same things, we should encourage each other, hang out. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B2\">yeah, let\u2019s get done with school work and then we\u2019ll as soon as we\u2019re done we\u2019ll meet. So even as I was finishing my final [ph] papers I was like e-mailing her, yeah, so I\u2019ll be done in a couple of days, let\u2019s hang. And then she didn\u2019t respond. [inaudible] responded a little later. [inaudible] okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B3\">when are you leaving for holidays? And then again, no response. And then she\u2019s like oops, I guess I didn\u2019t have any time. Happy New Year. So I was just like yeah, fuck you too. It really, really hurts, really disappointing. But because you can analyze it by saying I wanted something, I was expecting <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B4\">it and I didn\u2019t get it. So it really shakes my confidence too. [00:38:04.28] What the hell is wrong with me. I try so hard. I bend over backwards. I give people all my time and yet I\u2019m just not good enough for them. I can scream [inaudible] (pause) I don\u2019t know how to proceed when [inaudible] I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B5\">yeah, I guess I could be patient or [inaudible] I mean I do think that. They just don\u2019t feel the same way about me or at present they don\u2019t have a need for me like I do for them, to have other friends and la, la, la. They have families. [00:39:03.06] There are all these things I could tell myself and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B6\">[inaudible] this has nothing to do with me. But then it\u2019s like okay, so what do I do. How do I find people who have a need [ph] for me. Then they just reach out to me, help me with my thesis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: And how does that solve that problem?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: What problem?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: How does feeling like you that people aren\u2019t interested in you, how does sort of giving someone free labor solve a problem?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t I don\u2019t know what else to do except just learning to live by myself, learning to be alone and at peace with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: But you were describing spending every afternoon with this guy so that\u2019s not being alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561594\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, but once it\u2019s done, if it\u2019s just a transaction, then you won\u2019t he\u2019ll hang out with his other more fun friends once this is done. [00:40:09.10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: So then what do you do get out of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: I\u2019m getting his company until the applications are done. Not that I would delay them or anything, just so I can have more time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: What do you like about him? What do you like about spending time with him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: He\u2019s just much more positive. He\u2019s older. He\u2019s a writer, too, so we talk about interesting things, psychoanalyze people, talk about culture and literature. So yeah, it gives me a bit more weight when Nelson [ph] I met all his friends and [inaudible] and he\u2019s not met my mom or any of my friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">except this guy. [00:41:18.25] So it gives me I\u2019m not just some random person off the street. And this guy\u2019s fun so Nelson [ph] [inaudible] hang out and have fun [inaudible] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: I guess I\u2019m going to get to a point where people\u2019s opinions and whether they hang out with me or not doesn\u2019t bother me as much. [00:43:14.06] (pause) I feel like I\u2019m weak [ph] and I\u2019m too frazzled or [inaudible] whatever for people so I really I should have my act together before I enter society. [00:44:33.00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: What is entering society?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Just interacting with people. Like I almost set up at Thanksgiving an entirely new set of friends and school [ph] people I\u2019d seen maybe once or twice before. Then I feel like I\u2019m the whole time feeling insecure, and then exploding at that girl and being mean to her. [00:45:15.22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: We need to stop for today.

Yeah, 11.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Okay, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Great.
