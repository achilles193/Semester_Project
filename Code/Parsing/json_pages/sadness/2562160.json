It\u2019s just because first of all, it feels like it\u2019s all on me anyway, like Georgia isn\u2019t going to initiate that, even though she said she would sign whatever.  When friends find out or I e-mail friends, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">it all seems very quick and sudden. And in the moral world of dating and engagement, the non-religious world, it seems like it\u2019s more typical to have honor for your separation and give it a try. I clearly just don\u2019t want to be too hasty; but at the same time, I feel a lot of resolve for where I\u2019m at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">and it feels a little bit like where I was at with the church, finishing up the paperwork to remove my records. It\u2019s just kind of an additional chore that I don\u2019t want to think about, but it was over in my mind already.  I think there might be some insecurities around that, as well. I mean, it\u2019s a big <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">deal to get divorced and all that; but that said, it\u2019s impossible for me to imagine living with Georgia again (chuckles) at this point. It\u2019s just something [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:33). (pause) I guess I just need to schedule some time to do it. (pause)  One of the weird things is that it feels like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D4\">because Georgia works at [Falmouth] (ph?) and a lot of our friends were made through that connection, it\u2019s like I basically feel like I\u2019m obliged to step away from all of it and not participate in the friendships that I made with them, which is super weird because if that\u2019s the case, then they weren\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D5\">real friendships anyway, at least not very deep ones. (laughs) Maybe I felt like they were deeper in my mind than they really were. They were based on seeing each other at the gym and also through Georgia.  There are probably too many obstacles, but I don\u2019t know. Have you ever seen American Psycho with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D6\">Christian Bale or heard of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve heard of it. I may have seen ten minutes of it a long time ago, but for all intents and purposes, I haven\u2019t seen it \u2013 but I have heard of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I was watching it the other day just because it was on Netflix and it\u2019s funny because I can kind of relate in some ways. I think most people can. I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s a little disturbing. With the protagonist, he\u2019s talking about how there is this fa\u00e7ade that people seem to interact with, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">but that\u2019s not him. And then there is a scene in the movie where he\u2019s breaking up with his long-time girlfriend and she\u2019s like, \u201cWhat about all of our friends?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cYou can have them. You can have them all.\u201d  (laughs) I feel like that\u2019s basically what happened, except there was no agreement <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">or understanding or even discussion of it. I guess it makes sense. Georgia is a lot more extroverted and social and probably maintains those relationships better than I do, but all of a sudden I feel like I don\u2019t really have friends or pals or whoever to hang out with or talk through life with or whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">It\u2019s a bit isolating that way and I feel a little sociopathic. I know that\u2019s not a real term or anything, but just in the sense that all of these friendships that meant something to me, all of a sudden mean nothing to me.  It causes me to question what friendship is and the value of these tangential <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">relationships that I thought were more central. (pause) It\u2019s kind of one of those things in life where you get to test who is really your friend and who wants to support you, however that may be. I have a hard time determining how much of that is me being kind of introverted and not so great at staying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200115\">connected and how much of it is circumstantial because divorce and all of that is really weird and awkward for people.  It seems to me like, despite all that, if you have a real friendship then maybe people that are close to you would kind of reach out or whatever. That may be a false hope or expecting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200116\">too much from people. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20010-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20010-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562160\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20013\">THERAPIST: [I sense that you\u2019re feeling] (ph?) a bit sociopathic, like it refers to a kind of coldness or shutting down which I suspect, but am not sure, comes from feeling hurt and powerless.  You are going through what\u2019s been an awfully rough patch, which it seems like you\u2019re feeling is only to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200131\">good and what you want and so forth, but be that as it may, there is turmoil and it\u2019s been a tough time \u2013 and where the fuck is everybody?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. Or is that expecting too much of people? Even the commotion and complexity of this relationship where . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: My sense is that while you question that at one level, you\u2019re actually just pretty hurt at another level. In other words, stay back for a moment from what the social realities tends to be \u2013 whatever the hell those are \u2013 that you are wondering . . .  I don\u2019t know how many people have reached <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200171\">out to you or haven\u2019t or how they have or how often they\u2019ve checked in with you or what it\u2019s been like, but the feeling of being sociopathic \u2013 and I\u2019m not saying I think you are sociopathic \u2013 but I assume what you\u2019re referring to is a kind of coldness and shutting down and uncaring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, like a lack of empathy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Right. And I think that \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if this is always true \u2013 but I think for you now that\u2019s probably a response to what you\u2019re feeling quite hurt about people\u2019s reactions, which I think you then kind of reality check, like, \u201cWell, maybe I\u2019m off base. Maybe divorce is uncomfortable <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">for people or everybody is just going to be sympathetic to Georgia and not to me for any number of reasons.  She\u2019s more extroverted or I\u2019m the one who initiated this more so or whatever.\u201d That\u2019s reasonable to think about; I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t make sense to think about it, but I think it\u2019s most <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B2\">immediately a reaction to being hurt and upset that people haven\u2019t been in touch and you\u2019re going through a hard time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s a good point. I like to move more quickly past that into the application of that. It\u2019s like okay, this isn\u2019t a nice realization to have after however many years of making friendships with people.  And sure, some of them maybe are more circumstantial than others, but yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: No, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s probably common that there is reckonings where you do a check to see how many people are interested or aware in my life \u2013 who I consider friends, of course, not just anybody. It kind of makes me want to go through and [ ] (inaudible at [0:11:58]) the Facebook people (laughs) and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">all of that, like do a gleaning.  Or just close it altogether, but that\u2019s kind of like just doing nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562160\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">THERAPIST: But I think it\u2019s indicative. I think that is absolutely one of the ways that you have, since you were small, responded to being hurt \u2013 is to just say \u201cto hell with everybody.\u2019 It\u2019s vastly safer to want nothing to do with anybody. (both laugh) Fuck all of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, totally. (pause)  I think if anything, it\u2019s kind of like the take-away for me is develop these friendships carefully so that they are actually based in some kind of reality and not just the perception. Of course, there are some people that have been in touch. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s complete <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\">isolation. Aside from my family, maybe four friends who I alerted to what was going on, but they knew kind of anyway. But it\u2019s tough because they also have families and kids, not just wives, so it leaves me in this place now where . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: When you say \u201cit\u2019s tough,\u201d do you mean that they don\u2019t have a lot of time or that they\u2019re not that available because of the family stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly; and they\u2019re in a different place than I am. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re looking to go out and meet people or whatever, which is what I expected. I expected that it would be me on my own and then that transition would be kind of like a [solitaire,] (ph?) a singular one, a sole venture, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">which I chose intentionally because I wanted space and wanted to not be easily controlled and manipulated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I imagine you anticipated some of the social repercussions. It\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t see this coming, to some extent, socially, I suspect. But I don\u2019t have the sense that\u2019s what you would have ideally wanted. Do you know what I mean? So far, it has continued to seem pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">clear that you did ideally want not to live with Georgia and not be married. I do imagine you foresaw that it would have a big effect on your social circle social-wise, but I don\u2019t know that up as it sounds like you\u2019re having to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s interesting. That\u2019s a very good question. I don\u2019t know that I had it in mind. I think I knew it could be a consequence, but it\u2019s like maybe a bit disappointing to see how widespread it is.  It\u2019s just like Georgia\u2019s friends (chuckles) and her support group \u2013 and she probably needs <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">it more than I do because it seems like she has taken it a lot harder which, of course, I initiated it and so it will be harder for her. (pause) But you kind of lose a little bit of hope in humanity when that kind of stuff happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: They are the things that made me feel more misanthropic, (chuckles) these kinds of things.  It just reaffirms oh, yeah, I\u2019m fine by myself. That\u2019s the right way to go because you can\u2019t rely on other people necessarily for solace and comfort. You need to find that on your own, within. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: Honestly, even though in a way what you just said is bad news, I expect it\u2019s actually . . .  Another quality to your reaction, it seems to me, to this is it could have been what you just said \u2013 you can\u2019t really rely on other people for solace and comfort. You kind of have to find it in yourself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">I think you said something like that. It\u2019s way more varied and complicated than that, isn\u2019t it? I mean, sometimes you can; sometimes you can in certain ways, but not in other ways. I guess where I\u2019m going is to say I think you\u2019re simplifying it a lot because, again, it takes the ambiguity out. It takes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200332\">the unpredictability out. It takes the lack of being in control out. Do you see what I mean? To just say nope, nobody never no how.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562160\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: It\u2019s clear in black and white.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yes. I\u2019m not saying there aren\u2019t things like that.  I\u2019m sure there are, but I don\u2019t think your experience has been that you haven\u2019t ever been able to draw on anybody for anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: Right. That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I am pretty clear that you have been hugely disappointed by the most important people in your life since you were small.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s kind of what I was thinking, too. It\u2019s kind of like writing my parents off in a way, at certain points and stages in my life, after you realize they are taking way more than they\u2019re giving. (laughs) Georgia is the prime example of that, but it\u2019s just like the repetition of a pattern that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">I\u2019ve never seen the opposite of because we\u2019re all self-interested.  Of course, I doubt that Georgia would say that I was more giving than she was because it\u2019s always like you\u2019re just self-interested and ego-driven and some people\u2019s egos are bigger than others. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know that she would <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D2\">agree with me that she was more selfish than I was, that I was more invested in her life than she was in mine. I don\u2019t know that she would agree with me on that, but that\u2019s at least how it felt. It feels like, to me, it\u2019s one of the main reasons that it just couldn\u2019t work out any more and I told her <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D3\">that even and she felt I was being cruel when I said it.  She was like, \u201cThere is nothing I wouldn\u2019t have done.\u201d I think I told you this already. And I leveled with her on point because I could tell that I wasn\u2019t going to get too many options or opportunities to talk with her on the phone. It was best <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D4\">to just e-mail, logistics. She said, \u201cThere is nothing I wouldn\u2019t have done to keep our marriage together.\u201d And I just said, \u201cLook, Georgia, we went along this thing together and it became all about you at a certain point. Then there was a break and we got back together and we tried to recommit and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D5\">reconnect. You made it about you again. It was all about you.\u201d I didn\u2019t elaborate. I just said that it can\u2019t work for me and it just doesn\u2019t work.  And then I said too much, (laughs) but I wanted to say a whole lot more. I wanted to detail out why, in my mind, it was all about her. I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D6\">be able to handle it, but I don\u2019t know that she knows that she\u2019s just fundamentally very selfish. I think that\u2019s her blind spot. It works to her benefit in a lot of ways because she has her own business and she\u2019s driven and Type A and all of these things that are socially very rewarded. These are things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D7\">that are great. People like it when someone takes charge and, sure, she has a big ego, but you allow for that because she\u2019s Georgia and she\u2019s amazing. But living with someone like that means that you\u2019re constantly in their world, and I kept getting sucked into her world and losing myself to a certain <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D8\">degree \u2013 not entirely \u2013 but losing myself and my self-confidence because it\u2019s all based on her.  At least that\u2019s the way it felt to me. We were investing. We were investing a lot of money in her business and all of that, but that wasn\u2019t going to pay off for me at all, so where is the benefit of that? <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D9\">Not that I\u2019m just looking for financial, but I feel like my work in all of that has been sustained through Yale in a kind of minimal way (chuckles) because Yale is pretty cheap, actually. I never even supported equal amounts of money to what we were both doing.  It would be a very different situation <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D10\">now. I don\u2019t want to make it just about money, but I think that money, at least in this example, illustrates the interest and the time and attention that the two parties are getting. Every day. Every day we would talk about Georgia\u2019s work and I was helping her with the business. Never once would she <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D11\">really engage me in what I was doing \u2013 and I don\u2019t know that she would agree with that, but I think she would say that she would have a difficult time engaging in conversation about the work that I was doing because it\u2019s very specialized and all of that. But even from a consensual ballpark of, \u201cAll <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D12\">right, what are you doing? Let\u2019s look at all of the jobs that are available right now,\u201d or things like that, I feel like I helped Georgia more with than I got out. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562160\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">These kinds of caveats and examples come to mind. It\u2019s what I don\u2019t want to get into again with someone, even though there are a lot of benefits to being the sidekick of a very driven ego, big ego kind of individual. You get immediate connections and friends and people love you and the world is going <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F1\">in your direction, but it\u2019s at the cost of being kind of neglected and ultimately just not getting out of it what you put into it, it feels like.  And I think, of course, it makes sense to me why, in what feels like pretty mature phases of life, I got sucked into a relationship like Georgia\u2019s because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F2\">it reflected very much the relationship with both of my parents, who are both driven and both have their own worlds and their own egos where the world revolves around them; so it probably felt very natural to me. The awareness of \u201cthis isn\u2019t working,\u201d later on I kind of realized what\u2019s going on and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F3\">was like \u201cI have to get out of this. I don\u2019t want to continue to live in repeat patterns and I don\u2019t think Georgia is going to change enough that I would ultimately benefit in this.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">That\u2019s one thing I would be interested in. It seems to me like change is a really interesting thing in human nature. Some people are highly adaptive and can change dramatically. Other people really can\u2019t change very much. Maybe like baby steps and subtle things, but they have this kind of unalterable <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200411\">character. Would you say that\u2019s correct of a generalization?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking of, more specifically?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: More just like the character and personality of people. I feel like (chuckles) I\u2019m a very [mercurial,] (ph?) changeable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: Huh. And yet, you just explained how \u2013 I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not true \u2013 but you were also just explaining how your relationship with Georgia recapitulates a lot from your relationships with your parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562160\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20049\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s a good question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Continuity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D\">CLIENT: At least in my phases in life where I was not self-aware, and maybe that\u2019s part of it. I was just reacting. I was still in the religious embrace and it was suffocating and convoluted and all of that; but I definitely don\u2019t consider myself a mature adult when I was married and when I got married <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D1\">and all of that. These are decisions that I feel like were more made for me than by me. The \u201cme\u201d that I\u2019m referring to then, feels 100% different than me now; but I guess that might be off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I see. So that\u2019s the change you\u2019re wondering about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20051\">CLIENT: I understand the psychology. It\u2019s a really common thing now to say that everything is changeable. People change all the time, drastic changes, but what are the preconditions for change? Is it, I guess, self-awareness? Desire to change? I\u2019m just trying to think if I end up in this situation where <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200511\">I feel like \u201coh, no \u2013 this is the same thing I had with Georgia,\u201d how do I change that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">THERAPIST: I see. Like how do I make sure this never, ever happens again? (both laugh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">CLIENT: It\u2019s happened three times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">THERAPIST: Your parents and religion and Georgia. You want to be done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t want to get into this situation again. I know I\u2019m not going to remain a single guy the rest of my life \u2013 well, I don\u2019t know that, but that\u2019s kind of my assumption.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Right. And maybe you even want to be in a relationship, as long as you can be pretty damned sure that it\u2019s going to be different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I do think it\u2019s possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">CLIENT: How can you help facilitate change in another person? Because I\u2019ve changed dramatically and that has, consequently, made Georgia change in some ways. But some stuff she just couldn\u2019t and it was clear that she\u2019s still in a religious mindset. Her morays and her rule following will always be there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200611\">She\u2019ll always [ ] (inaudible at 00:30:59) about stuff and controlling and very driven in her world.  I couldn\u2019t avert her from that path. I can\u2019t change that, or at least it felt like I couldn\u2019t now. Psychologists say anything is changeable. You can change all of this, but I didn\u2019t have access to that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200612\">at least in any of the major relationships in my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">THERAPIST: Right. Let\u2019s see. (long pause)  It seems to me you actually changed pretty considerably in your relationship with Georgia, I think, over the last year or so.  I guess here\u2019s what I have in mind: Even before you decided you wanted to split up, it seems to me that you had a pretty different <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200631\">view, a pretty different story about what was going on between you when you had had a while prior. It seems to me that came about through a combination of things \u2013 the stuff with Liam, obviously, stirred up a lot. There was some sort of events like that and then, I think, there was also your examination, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200632\">here and elsewhere, of your experience with her. Do you know what I mean?  It seems to me that what you just said about how selfish and, in ways, one-sided you felt things could be between you is not something you would have said two or three years ago in the same way, I don\u2019t think. I don\u2019t think you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200633\">would have disagreed with some of the observations, but I don\u2019t think you would have quite put it like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562160\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">THERAPIST: And I think you changed that on the basis of getting in touch, particularly with bad feelings you had, ways she made you feel bad or things happened between you that made you feel bad, that you, for reasons \u2013 some of which we have talked about, I think \u2013 you haven\u2019t wanted to focus on before. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200671\">Like turning off my light switch and wanting things from her point of view and not wanting to cause conflict.  And also, I think, if you were going to feel bad, it was going to be way off on your own and you were going to keep that very separate from things between the two of you. I guess it seems to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200672\">me that it was a combination of events, but I guess the other thing really would be you leaving religion, your having some time on your own in Geneva, Georgia\u2019s stuff with Liam. That stuff clearly set things in motion, in a way. I\u2019m not saying inevitably to this conclusion, but those stirred a lot up. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200673\">And then you paid a lot of attention, it seems to me, and whether you had as much of things that you hadn\u2019t wanted to see before that were really bothering you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a shame that it took some separation and some space for me to even realize that. I feel like it\u2019s kind of a personal flaw that I\u2019m not able to process that immediately. It\u2019s like isolation for me has made me realize that this is not a good thing and I thought it was, but it was not. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know this for a fact; I\u2019m just wondering.  I\u2019m not so sure it was as bad in the beginning as it was more recently. I really could be wrong, but when you were sort of thoroughly in religion and just had a very different vision of, I think, who you were, where your life was going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B1\">take you, what you wanted, I would guess the equation was different or the costs and benefits were different. Sure, maybe you were really out of touch with some things that really mattered and you were hurt and upset in ways you didn\u2019t realize by things between you and Georgia but, again, I guess I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B2\">not convinced.  Again, I could be wrong with this, but I\u2019m not convinced that this was just kind of a wrong-headed decision from the start. Do you know what I mean? You were in a pretty different world when the two of you got married.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: Absolutely. I see it as kind of a maturation process. I was still a child and under a lot of different types of conditioning, one from how my parents had behaved and how I then, consequently, reacted; and for religion as well \u2013 the social pressures and expectations I mean \u2013 which makes for odd <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D1\">relationships anyway. All religious relationships are weird, so I think that you\u2019re right.  There was this way in which Georgia was a parental figure, as well as a sexual partner and everything else that a wife is, like a way for me to kind of work through my issues with my parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Spouses are almost always, to some extent, that; but she may have been more so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, it seems very much like that. That\u2019s just like what relationships are valid? We\u2019ve already narrowed the [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:35) (laughs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">THERAPIST: There is always that dimension. Sometimes there is more; sometimes there is less. Sometimes you work it out and [sometimes you divorce.] (ph?) Sometimes there is not much to work out. I\u2019m saying I think it\u2019s always a dimension to what people are doing; but how much and how problematic, those <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200731\">are different questions.  I think sometimes somebody marries somebody who is kind of like their parent in a way and that works great for them, or that\u2019s the overriding part. Other times not. Obviously, it gets pretty nuanced.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562160\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20075\">CLIENT: Totally, and I think in the beginning when we shared the same world view, it definitely was working and it was a great way for me to feel validated and autonomous from my parents because I had Georgia as a parental figure; and then I outgrew her. I think that\u2019s kind of, if I could put it simply, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200751\">that would be it. I think that\u2019s really a good point. I feel like I outgrew her because I changed much more and adapted much more than she ever could.  I think she would still be religious if I had not said what I did and all of that. I know I\u2019m not going to change fundamentally who she is as a person <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200752\">and I realize that now; but at the time, fundamentally who she was, was what I was looking for in replacement of my parents. Now that I\u2019ve matured into an adult, I no longer want to live with a parent. My issues with my parents are more resolved than my relationship with Georgia. (laughs) (pause)  I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200753\">tend to kind of say, \u201cWell, it was a good first marriage,\u201d and leave it at that and say that I\u2019ve matured, passed it, and grew out of the relationship at some point. I\u2019m kind of devoid of emotion in that regard. It\u2019s just a matter of not getting back into something that\u2019s pretty remotely parental in this way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20077\">THERAPIST: We have to stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20079\">CLIENT: It was really insightful. Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Well, good. I\u2019m glad it was helpful. Let\u2019s see, scheduling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">CLIENT: Probably just [ ] (inaudible at 00:42:42).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Do you want to come in again this week if I can find something? Do you want to wait until next week? I guess that would be the whole thing for me to know and then I will go from there. At least from my side, we can settle into some kind of more routine thing in the next few weeks. My schedule <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F1\">is still a little [flaky] (ph?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s cool because except for Friday, my schedule is still pretty open. It\u2019s just that mornings are harder for me. I think we can do one next week. I\u2019m feeling pretty settled and a lot of things are not turning over as much as it was, for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">THERAPIST: Then I will get in touch with that in time for next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">CLIENT: Perfect.
