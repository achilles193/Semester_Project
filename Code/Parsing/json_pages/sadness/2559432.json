I'm just going to grab some water. (pause at 00:00:07 until 00:00:22)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Good morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Morning. So how are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I'm okay. So Tanya is coming home today at least in theory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I haven't heard from them exactly when she's coming out. So. I think that's a good thing. She's definitely tired of being there. And so staying there may or may not help for much longer. The sucidality seems to be going. At least for now. So that's good. I'm sure she's she's talking with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">Chad about not starting the job search again immediately. Which is good. I support that because my real concern was that she was going to come out and attempt to jump right back into everything that had put her into the hospital in the first place. So. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: That looks like it's not going to happen. So. That's reassuring. She's going to continue doing the E.C.T. and they're saying easy path if she's not doing well for the E.C.T. admission people to admit her back into the unit she's in currently. So that's good. It's kind of like there is a safety <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">net for this. Which I think is an important thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: The other thing is like if she comes out and suddenly gets worse again, then we go back to the emergency room. That's a nightmare really. And then we go somewhere else. There is no guarantee we'd end up back in Frederick. And there is no guarantee we'd end up anywhere that was very helpful. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">I guess we've been to four different hospitals now. And I feel like two of them would be less helpful to return to than the other two. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Is that where you went two weeks ago? You went to the E.R. first? Is that-?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. We don't know any better admissions route when she's in the wants to kill herself crisis. (inaudible at 00:02:22) somewhere to stabilize. And then they never have a bed in whatever hospital you go to. So they always do a bed search and send you wherever they have a bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: So. We got lucky this time that it was Frederick that had a bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: So that's that. I'm a little nervous because I think Tanya is upset with me because she told me on Monday that she wanted to get out. And on Sunday she hadn't been particularly well. Much better than the previous Sunday but not in sort of the normal range of (pause at 00:02:59 until 00:03:06). <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">(inaudible) And normal is a really -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Subjective? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. If you picked the average person off the street the normal range of their moods, I'm not sure she was in the bottom end of that in the worst part of Sunday. So it's a little concerning to have her say the next day, \"No I should definitely be coming home on Wednesday.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Well I'm a little concerned that you're going to come back and want to kill yourself because you're going to want to do all of the work again. (pause at 00:03:33 until 00:03:40) That conversation didn't go very well. She didn't want to hear that. And (pause at 00:03:44 until 00:03:50). I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">know exactly why that was. There are two components I think that I'm pretty sure are going on. One is the E.C.T. is making it hard for her to remember things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559432\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">And so it's making it hard for her to have long conversations because she can't remember with perfect clarity everything that went on in the beginning of the conversation. And the other is she has I think some abandonment anxiety and so me saying, \"I'm not sure that's a good idea\" I think triggered <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">some idea of like I was just going to leave her in the hospital or something. But I'm not sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. So did you guys get into a fight over it or-?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: I think she would describe it as a fight. I didn't think we were fighting but she seemed pretty convinced while it was happening that we were fighting. But I didn't have anything to fight over so I'm not really sure what was I was mostly confused as to what was happening I guess I would say. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">I feel like there are these concerns that need to be addressed. And then she seemed to have enough anxiety that she almost couldn't respond. And then I would ask her what was going on and she would just kind of not have an answer. (pause at 00:05:13 until 00:05:21) I didn't feel like it was a fight <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">but she did. So I guess that counts? I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: So. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: What has it been like for you having her go through E.C.T.?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Well she's just had her well today she will have had her fifth session and it changes a little bit every time. So she responded really badly to the medications they administer with it the first time. And just was really weepy and depressed and had a very bad headache the first day. So they <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">started giving her ibuprofen so the headache wasn't there the second time and she was less sad. I think the second time was the time she woke up and couldn't remember who she was as first. So I think that was a little hard for her to deal with. I have avoided imagining what that's like because I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">like one of us experiencing that is enough at any given moment but I can say that was pretty bad for her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">The third time it was better on both of those two fronts but she then started to it became more clear the next day or two that she was kind of forgetting pieces of conversations. But she would remember all of the conversation and then not the start of the conversation that happened right after it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">And then she would remember all of the next conversation. So it was just like it seemed entirely random as to what she remembered and didn't remember. So it's kind of interesting at that point. It also seemed like it was working a little bit in terms of her moods seemed better. She seemed cheerful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">After the fourth treatment on Monday she seemed to this is when we had the maybe fight she seemed to have a much harder time remembering a whole range of things. It was still random but it was just more frequent for recent things. (pause at 00:07:24 until 00:07:31) And then she seems to get stuck <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">in trying to remember whatever specific thing she really wants to remember at that moment. So it gets hard to have a conversation of much length. So that's been an evolving thing and a little bit strange in each step. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Mm. Well that sounds like that's what it's been like for her mostly. And I can't imagine this is anything short of terrifying for you. At least at times.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559432\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: The whole situation is terrifying. I'm not particularly worried about the E.C.T. at this point. (pause at 00:08:13 until 00:08:22) From the bit of reading that I did I'm pretty confident that the if the memory effects are going to be short term so she may never remember very well these few <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">weeks. But that seems like a small price to pay. If it works. If it doesn't work I'm not sure that some of the other medications haven't done things that are just as bad. So I'm not particularly scared of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">I am in a general sense terrified that she's still we still don't have a really good treatment plan. And that she'll kill herself. (pause at 00:08:59 until 00:09:09) Well. (pause at 00:09:09 until 00:09:21) I'm less worried about that today than I was Sunday or Monday. I was less worried Monday than <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">I was Sunday but (pause at 00:09:29 until 00:09:37). This particularly bad Sunday I felt like she'd regressed several days and was back to a pretty unhopeful place pretty quickly. That's not what I like to see in the sort of trends of the treatment. But still very early in the E.C.T. Or it was then. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">The normal course seems to be eight to twelve doses.  (pause until 00:10:21)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: And you've been continuing to talk to people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:10:26) Yeah I've continued to talk to my parents and to Tanya's father. Sometimes with her sister who arrived last night. Sometimes I've just been e-mailing back and forth with her sister but either way it's somewhat helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: And I have a good friend who is here. Also lives in Andover. He's been going out to visit Tanya with me because they're also good friends. About half the time. So that's been good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: See I've been talking to people. That's helpful. (pause at 00:11:02 until 00:11:21) Yeah it's helpful. At some point everyone is in a sense just scared and helpless. And so there is some amount of that that is reassuring and there is some amount of talking about it that's reassuring. There is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">some extent to which it doesn't address the root problem for anybody. But that's the situation we're in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (pause at 00:11:42 until 00:12:05)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: The loneliness seems to go along with the fear. So the more scared I am that Tanya is going to die, the more lonely I feel also. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I don't know if those are directly related in that way or if they both just stem from her being really unwell. And so in a sense not present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: I'm not sure. (pause at 00:12:25 until 00:12:34) I would say that the talking with people has helped less this weekend with the loneliness. Just there's it's just hard to have Tanya be getting dramatically better really and then really not be as well. Or not seem as well. Of course by Monday <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">she'd had E.C.T. and didn't really remember not feeling well on Sunday. So I'm not quite sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. So. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: You remembered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah I did. It's a little strange to have the conversation where \"Well you really weren't that well yesterday.\" And she's \"I wasn't?\" \"No.\" Don't really remember. So. (inaudible at 00:13:23) good. You may as well not remember that. (chuckles) If you forget anything, let's forget that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">But it's still yeah I guess I have to deal with that alone then too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559432\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause at 00:13:37 until 00:13:45) Well it's like this is a comparison that makes sense in some sense. Like a spouse who has Alzheimer's. Obviously the memory problem is pretty short lived and so forth but just feeling like your realities are very different. And feeling like that person <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">is out of touch and hard to make contact with. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah I fortunately it's not nearly a perfect analogy. But Alzheimer's seems pretty terrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:14:15)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: I didn't mean to scare you with that analogy. I was trying to just search for something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: No you no. That had occurred to me also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: That particular one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: And that may be because my friend who is a poet and his wife is a neuroscientist she studies Alzheimer's. So it's kind of it's a disease that it's in the forefront of my knowledge in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: So. I've talked with them about the E.C.T. so it's kind of like it falls in her court in some way because it's a memory issue. And so it occurred to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: It's not the same and I'm glad of that. But it does have a lot of similar elements. Yeah. The realities we live in are somewhat different. And I have this sense of her not living in the reality that actually is real in some way. There is a world going on. And just because she doesn't remember <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">an element of it doesn't mean that it wasn't there. (pause at 00:15:23 until 00:15:30)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: But I guess I mean maybe the analogy can stretch even further. Because if we don't think about the memory issue per se there is this feeling that you don't know what is going on for her. And in a much more systemic way is kind of just something that is a different kind of reality. I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">being in the mindset of wanting to end your life is a particular kind of reality that certainly you're not in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: And it's hard for you to relate to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: That's right. Yeah it's not one I've ever been in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: For which I'm glad. But really don't know exactly where she is when she goes that way. Yeah that's right. (pause at 00:16:15 until 00:16:39) Yeah that's particularly hard because then I have no idea what to do or say. It's very clear to me that there's not good things to do and say but it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">not exactly clear what they are until I have already said them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: And then they don't always work the same way the next time around. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. It's kind of like shock treatment? I mean not E.C.T. but shock treatment. You do something and then you get a negative like you get shocked or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: There is some negative consequence. That's what I mean. (inaudible at 00:17:09)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, no. That's exactly right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: That's not a great way to learn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: It's certainly not a fun way to learn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think you learn not to do things that shock you but if I think. If I understand it correctly one of the problems with abuse is in general not having a really clear sense of when the shock is coming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559432\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: So it falls into a category more like that. There is a shock but I don't always know when it's going to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Learning can't take place in that context if there is no correlation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Right. Right. Yeah and maybe the system is non-linear and that's why there is no obvious linear correlation. But non-linear systems are really hard to (inaudible at 00:17:54) out of. So we still don't have a good internal sense of how to do that. Yeah. (pause at 00:18:06 until 00:18:56) And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B11\">then it's hard making any sort of decision with her at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">Now the E.C.T. booklet that we have recommends that you not make any important life decisions while doing E.C.T. because you may not be able to remember all of the important factors which makes sense. But somewhere in here we're attempting to decide what role you play. Our therapists. I mean I can't <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">really have enough of a conversation with her to be sure of what she really wants or needs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: And I'm not really comfortable making a decision of that magnitude for both of us without some reliable input from her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: I'm not sure she's going to remember from day to day what she said the previous day about any specific topic. This one included. So I don't want to make a decision with her and then act on it. And then say \"Oh no, no. You totally agreed to that.\" Because that seems like then she's alien to herself <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">also or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: When it comes to that decision I mean I think I agree. We'll figure it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: No need to make something today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Okay. I appreciate that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: You know it would be fine. The three of us can meet when it sounds like next week she'll be out and we can talk about it then. That seems like yeah we can figure that out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: It doesn't seem like from my vantage point why this needs to happen right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Unless you really feel like you really need your space soon. Outside of her. And then maybe that's something to think about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause at 00:20:31 until 00:20:38) I don't have any issues that are separate from what she's dealing with right now. Or not any of any real significance. So I guess I don't need my own space in that regard. I have a general sense right now that while she's in this memory state, couples' <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">counseling is not going to be enormously effective because it tends to be a long session. And she can't remember for a five minute conversation what was going on at the beginning or keep it all bundled up in some way that I don't know that we're going to make a whole lot of progress of any kind. (pause <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D32\">at 00:21:20 until 00:21:33)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Will she be going to her sessions with Chad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: She's been calling him a couple of times a week. I mean it's not the same over the phone. And so if she does get out today hopefully she'll be able to go to her Friday session with Chad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: So that would be good. (inaudible at 00:21:53) group counseling in the hospital but that's also a different thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Does she find that helpful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: I think it depends on the make up of the group and who's running it. Some of them I think she finds helpful. Some of them I think she really doesn't like.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559432\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Well now I want to talk more about other decisions maybe that you have on your mind because you said decisions in general. But you'll have my support in some form whether I'm meeting with the two of you, whether I'm meeting with you alone. As I've said for probably since the beginning <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">there is sort of an exigency to this situation that having sort of a rulebook makes really no sense. So to have some thoughtful fluidity is what my goal is right now. You know? So I don't -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: (whispered) Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Nothing needs to be determined today or next week for that matter. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Okay. Great. Thank you. That's helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: That's helpful. I think you said the same thing last week but (chuckles) but it got hard to remember that as the week went on. So I felt more like we needed to have some sort of decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. And I had sort of like in retrospect and sort of e-mailing Tanya I don't know. That could of waited. I like to have her feel included but there's yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: (laughs) I think it was a good thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: It certainly didn't hurt in any way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: So I think that was good. It gave her a chance to directly weigh in to you so that I'm not relaying messages one way. So I think that was good. There is this sense in which I'm not really sure whether what we need right now is a couples' therapist. Or whether each of us just needs our own like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F71\">therapy of some kind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: So my thought about that is I agree with that mostly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: In terms of like couples' therapy in quotes, traditional where people work on issues to better the relationship, I mean that's ridiculous at this moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: I mean it's really ridiculous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: (laughing) Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: In the sense again really in a very sort of narrow sense. Traditional sense. Tanya is very ill right now and she needs to get better. And so even in the context of you're feeling like you want to be infuriated with her if you want to be and feeling like what's the impact on her I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201051\">for you to be concerned about that or that wasn't a really good example. Yeah. So traditionally conceived couples' therapy doesn't make a whole lot of sense right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">That's not to say that I can't be a support for the two of you in meeting with you and just thinking about the meaning of her illness. Practical considerations for the week. I mean I think there is a lot of good that can be done. I do feel and I think I said this in the e-mail that you being in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201071\">your own treatment does seem like a priority in my mind but they're not mutually exclusive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: You know with me I think they would be but getting both those needs met are not mutually exclusive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Right. Okay. (pause at 00:25:10 until 00:25:19) Yeah and so I'm not sure what we need to do. It's (pause at 00:25:24 until 00:25:53). Yeah it's sort of like I don't really know what Tanya needs. I think there is an element in which we started coming here because Tanya wanted me <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D1\">to being seeing someone. That was not the whole reason we started coming but I think that was in her mind also. And so yeah I just really don't know what we need at this point. And I don't have a very clear vision of what individual therapy looks like because this is the closest to that that I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D2\">ever done. So -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2010C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559432\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">THERAPIST: It would look like this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">CLIENT: It would?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: It could look like this. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: Okay. All right. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: Did you have other thoughts about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: Well just in the sense of there are uncertainties in a lot of different pieces of the decision. And it's hard to decide in the face of uncertainty. Just try to take (inaudible at 00:26:49) outcome but it's not a good way to pick it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: If you don't really know enough things. In this case I don't really know what Tanya needs or wants from the situation. So I can kind of talk with her and then I have to assess how reliable what she said is as an indicator of what she needs and wants. (pause at 00:27:07 until 00:27:22)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Well I think it's also sort of what were you just thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">CLIENT: I was thinking well the experimentalist in me wants to just ask her a few more times and see if the response is more or less consistent. If we kind of converge on a consistent response that's probably a decent indicator of what she at least thinks she needs. She may not remember it so it would <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201211\">be okay. That's kind of what were you going to say? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: On a really practical level yeah. I mean on a really practical level you guys can get both. In terms of meeting someone together and you meeting with someone individually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">CLIENT: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">THERAPIST: So on a really practical level that can and will happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">CLIENT: Sure. Sure. But also on a practical level she also needs to be doing E.C.T. three times a week. At least for the next week or two or however long. And that means going (inaudible at 00:28:21). An hour for the treatment. A couple hours for recovery. Come back and then someone has to stay with <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201291\">her for the rest of the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">CLIENT: Just as part of the treatment. I think there is a risk of seizure or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Are you the only one doing that right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">CLIENT: Um, well while her sister is in town, which will be through Sunday, no. After that we don't have a plan. It sounds to me like you're hesitant to have me be the only one doing that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">CLIENT: And I am hesitant to be the only one doing that particularly in light of your previous recommendations on similar subjects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">CLIENT: So my friend Neal, if he's in town, I think would be willing to do at least some of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">CLIENT: At least some of the time. And there are Tanya's kind of become a part of a church community in downtown Denver over the last year. And I feel like there is a way to get some support in that process from them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Mm. Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\">CLIENT: So. And I don't have an answer as to how we're going handle it but it is on my mind not to just do it myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20145\">CLIENT: But that's three days a week there. Then the other two days presumably Tanya is going to want to do individual therapy with Chad. Because she's probably not going to be able to do it at least some of those three days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">CLIENT: She's been meeting with Chad four times a week. So now on a practical level where do we fit in couples' therapy while she's doing that? In addition to it I just don't think it's a good idea. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20148-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20148-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559432\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">CLIENT: But we need to do it. So there is kind of like the practical concerns. Like it doesn't seem useful. And I don't know when it becomes useful again because I don't know when she's going to stop doing E.C.T.

It's kind of whenever she's in the hospital there is this question of who should come visit her. Does she want Franco to come with me on any specific day? Does she want her father to come up? So I sort of have to make those decisions. At <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201611\">this point. (pause at 00:31:20 until 00:31:31) There is a sense in which she didn't want to make those decisions while depressed. She didn't want to face any sort of decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">And then started the E.C.T. and is maybe not a place to make major decisions. So it's kind of been a continuous process while she's been in the hospital of not really being wholly in control of her decision making process or something. Not that I would say it in those words to her. (pause at 00:31:58 <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201631\">until 00:32:05) Which is tough because I've worked very hard particularly during our married time to make decisions that affect both of us together. Actually I don't think unilateral decisions are in general a successful strategy. Certainly they need to be made sometimes but if we can work together <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201632\">to make a decision it seems like we ought to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">CLIENT: So we have done that. So now we're in a place where we can't anymore but the thing that I'm used to doing is to talk through the decision and kind of look at the options together. And then pick one together. So I guess I don't have any other good examples off hand. But mostly it's been visitation <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201671\">things. And then this therapy thing. I guess the question of when she leaves and what she's going to do once she's left. You know that's been very important to me for her not to get out and go right back into the same situation that seems like it precipitated the problem. She agreed with me last week <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201672\">and then kind of over the weekend seems to have forgotten that was an obvious concern or something. And so by Monday really wants to get out of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">For me the circumstances external are still the same. She hasn't done anything to get back to doing work inside. And it's not clear to me that she won't want to start applying for jobs as soon as she gets out. Now that was the situation Monday. Today I don't feel like that's the same thing. Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201691\">I've raised those concerns and she talked with Chad the next morning. And he said, \"Well I don't think you should go back to doing a job search at all when you get out. Like you should just wait for awhile and see if the E.C.T. works. Because we'll know in a couple of weeks. And I don't think you need <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201692\">to be looking for a job during that.\" Which is fine. I am very okay with that. I just didn't think she would be capable of doing that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20168-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20168-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559432\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">But I feel like with that recommendation from him and some insistence from me she'll be able to do that. That's why I'm okay with it but (pause at 00:34:35 until 00:34:46). I feel like I've talked into a bit of muddle. But the decision is sort of what are we doing with her treatment? And what are <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B1\">we doing with easing her back into normal life? One strategy was to have her stay in for longer. And then ease back into it while in a safe place. One strategy is for her to come back out and ease into it under therapeutic guidance of her outpatient treatment team.  (pause until 00:35:25)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">There is not any good reason to prefer one over the other. Or not any there are reasons to prefer each. The only reason I had been leaning towards the residential one is that I wasn't sure we had the margin of error necessary to do the outpatient one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">CLIENT: I think we might at this point. And particularly if she is actually willing to ease into things. And it seems like Chad is going to continue to push her in that direction. Then I think it will be okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">CLIENT: But again it's a conversation in her mind it was almost a fight from the start. And in my mind was I don't know what. I would try to say things like what I've just talked about. She would (pause at 00:36:19 until 00:36:26) seemingly not be able to grasp what I was saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">CLIENT: Which is really not usually the case in talking to Tanya. So. It's kind of a big decision though. How are we moving forward in this treatment? To not be able to discuss it and have some agreed plan is not easy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (pause at 00:36:49 until 00:36:56) So then you end up feeling like you need to make the decisions for her treatment alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah ultimately if she can't. And if her treatment team isn't making them with all of the considerations that seem correct to me not that I trust Chad. I think he's got a very good handle on where Tanya is. I'm not always as sure about inpatient treatment teams because their focus tends <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D1\">to be very much on stabilization in the moment. That's a good thing. An important thing. But stabilization is really useless if you get someone stable and then send them right back to where they were because the instability was caused by something. So if the cause isn't gone then you've done nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D2\">other than keep them alive and delay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20181\">CLIENT: So I think they're more aware of that than it looks like they are because they very rarely talk with me directly. They do it maybe on intake and maybe on release. I guess always on release. And so I only get things filtered through Tanya as information for what they're doing. But they're not <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201811\">telling her everything that they're thinking and then she's not so. Perhaps my distrust of the inpatient treatment teams is unwarranted. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20180-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20180-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559432\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20183\">THERAPIST: I think they very much see things the way you described. I don't even know if they would call it a treatment team because it is a sort of getting out of the crisis and moving on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20185\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20187\">THERAPIST: I don't even know if they would think of it as treatment per se. (inaudible at 00:38:40)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20189\">CLIENT: I see. Just stabilization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018B\">THERAPIST: I do. I think that's what inpatient I mean with the E.C.T. component hopefully but I do think that most inpatient units that's what they see their role as.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018F\">THERAPIST: I could be mistaken in that. But I don't know if that's comforting or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20191\">CLIENT: Um it's comforting in that I like it better when I can trust what I observe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20193\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20195\">CLIENT: So it's comforting to have you say, \"No that seems about right.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20197\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20199\">CLIENT: It's not really comforting in terms of taking care of Tanya. And it sort of plays into my feeling that I need to be monitoring very carefully how they decide to handle her situation because they are not considering all of the relevant factors all of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019B\">THERAPIST: Yeah I mean I was trying to sort of think and then draw some analogies. I mean it's very difficult to have a spouse who is ill. And a spouse who can't collaborate with her treatment the illness impairs that to some extent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Then when you as the spouse are integrally involved in a sense providing some of that treatment, providing \"just being there\" and make sure she's okay. You're not sort of on the side eliciting treatment but you're also sort of participating in it. Then the burden is all the more on you. Which <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2019F1\">I think why I've been particularly focused on having whatever we can build in place so that all the burden doesn't fall on you. I think I've been sort of attentive to that. Very much so. But one thing that sort of made me think what you said a few minutes ago about return to normal. I mean that's the <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2019F2\">biggest difficulty in this all what is normal going to be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A3\">THERAPIST: I don't think it's clear and I imagine that's extremely difficult. It's almost like farcical to think about planning in the context of not knowing what to expect. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A5\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah there is some of that. (pause at 00:40:43 until 00:40:49) Yeah I don't know what normal is. You look around what people do. Work some job and pay the bills and do whatever. People seem more or less happy. It'd be nice to get back to someplace like that but I believe that that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201A51\">available. I don't know exactly what the path is to get there. I feel like that's not impossible to get back to a place where Tanya is doing something that she loves and finds fulfilling. And also pays her at least a little bit. I think that's possible. (pause at 00:41:32 until 00:41:39) So I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201A52\">that's sort of the end point goal that I would call normal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A9\">CLIENT: But we're so far outside of the range of normal anyway. Most people with any kind of depression seem to respond to some medication. So she's far out on the tail in terms of the number of medications she's gone through that don't work. But the E.C.T. is supposed to work for that category of people <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201A91\">fairly effectively. Two thirds of people is a lot. And that's about the number for people who don't have psychotic episodes and fit into that category or fit into non-medicated category. But yeah I don't know what normal means.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559432\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB\">THERAPIST: That's deeply unsettling. When you sort of function day to day with some concept of normal. I mean if everyday you wake up and who knows what will happen then in some very profound sense it's not very settling. And you have some sense that not everything is up in the air but I guess I'm just <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB1\">trying to sort of normalize the un-normalness of it. To provide a context for not having a context. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AD\">CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AF\">THERAPIST: If that makes any sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B1\">CLIENT: No it makes really good sense. One of the problems that I first had adjusting to Tanya's family is that no plan you make ever is going to be executed the way it's said. And in part someone is going to make the plan and they're going to tell it to other people differently. Because it's probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201B11\">going to change between telling it to different people. So then everyone gets together and the plan never goes the way that anyone thought that it was going to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B3\">For me my family just kind of makes a plan and then we do the plan. It's just how it always goes. It might change a little bit but not much. That was very unsettling for the first several years. Eventually I just realized that the plan is nothing is going to go according to plan. It's helped me get <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201B31\">through the last three years just fine in interacting with her family. I don't make any plans and then expect them to be followed through in the same way that they were made. And somehow I'm very okay with that. So it seems like you're trying to do something similar with this circumstance. And say \"Well <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201B32\">it's really not clear what's going to happen. That's what's going to happen.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B5\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) That's the clarity. Exactly. (laughter) (inaudible at 00:44:15)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yeah that's helpful. The other thing I was thinking of is so most of chemistry is done in equilibrium things so all of our just about everything is done in equilibrium. But there are some reaction regimes that are just really far from equilibrium. So then most of the normal laws don't hold <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201B71\">because you're just really far from the point where everything was derived and studied very carefully. And so we're kind of in that same situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Mm. Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BB\">CLIENT: So the important thing is again to recognize that we're not in this one place. And it's just we're elsewhere. It's really unclear. But it is clear that we are elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. The most unpredictable something can be is trying to impose a predictable model that doesn't fit. Right? (chuckles) That's sort of what you're saying if you use <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BF\">CLIENT: Yeah I think that might be right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. So if you use a random model you'll get it right some percentage of the time depending on the distributions. And if you use the wrong model entirely you could get it wrong every time. Yeah I think that's right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. We're going to need to stop in a moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C7\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C9\">THERAPIST: How about I mean should the plan be that I'll see you next week and if you guys decide that Tanya is in a good place to come with you we'll do that.
