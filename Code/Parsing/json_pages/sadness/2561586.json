Everything\u2019s okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I think the thing\u2019s up in the air.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m in this weird\u2026 It\u2019s a weird place I\u2019m in, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">More and more, I feel, \u201cWow, I think that going Assyria is the perfect thing.\u201d It\u2019s just timing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">I\u2019m so careful about not impulsively trying to get away from stuff. Then I realize that I\u2019m clearly not. If I\u2019m thinking about it, if I\u2019m that aware of it, that means I\u2019m not doing that \u2013 probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">Then I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, but then when I go there, there are going to be problems there, too. It\u2019s not going to be perfect.\u201d It\u2019s all these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">On the other hand, I do feel like, \u201cWell, you know what? It\u2019s not going to be perfect, but I think I\u2019m underestimating certain potentials there.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">The last time I was doing my research, I remembered other people I know. My one friend George is a CEO of some bank over. I know some pretty well-connected people over there. (inaudible at 00:02:21) easier for them to move there, because they were already kind of well-off. They\u2019re living like kings <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">over there. On the other hand, that\u2019s the exact reason why they don\u2019t have to go there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">That means that they, I think, would be very excited to have someone like me. I don\u2019t know, I feel like I\u2019m underestimating possibilities there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: What do you think about that (inaudible at 00:02:55)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: How\u2019s that doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Hasn\u2019t been consistent (inaudible at 0:03:02).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: (laughs) It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not your fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: When you think about the kind of person that (inaudible at 00:03:10), is there something you say might underestimate your potential. What do you picture? You\u2019re not picturing working in a bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not picturing working in a bank, but I am picturing\u2026 George\u2019s also involved in all these non-profits. It\u2019s not a big country. There\u2019s definitely a network of these people on a certain level who all\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: People who might know people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Exactly. \u201cMy friend Brian (sp) is coming. This guy\u2019s great, he\u2019s educated, I vouch for him, blah-blah-blah. He\u2019s going to be teaching at (inaudible at 00:03:49) but he needs another job.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">I\u2019m really starting to panic a little bit.  This isn\u2019t, \u201cOh, maybe I\u2019ll do it.\u201d I have to decide, now, exactly what I\u2019m doing. Next thing we know, it\u2019s going to be the end of January, it\u2019s going to be February.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">On some level, when do I go? If there\u2019s nothing going on here, and if any of these guys were able to hook me up with something over there\u2026 That\u2019s just the reality. I\u2019ve doubled my effort here just because I have to, and also because I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m going to get over there, but nothing\u2019s happening yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">It\u2019s starting to make me think about, \u201cWell, what\u2019s more\u2026\u201d Especially now that I have this mindset of, \u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d I go, it doesn\u2019t work out, I come back. Darien isn\u2019t going anywhere, and not having a job here is not going anywhere. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Do you have any sense about what you would be ideal?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561586\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Ideal? Ideal would be if these classes are good [in any way] (ph). Ideally, I\u2019d go there \u2013 or I\u2019d find something beforehand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Before going \u2013 find something here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Here or there. If it\u2019s here, great, to make money. Or find something there and just go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s part of what I\u2019m wondering (ph). Where do you want to be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: That I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: What if you knew you could have a job that could pay the bills (inaudible at 00:05:36)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: That\u2019s hard to say. I don\u2019t know, it depends on what the job is. If UConn called me tomorrow and said, \u201cWe want you to teach in a creative writing program,\u201d that\u2019s hard to turn down. It\u2019s here. It\u2019s an amazing school. It depends on the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">If I got some job that I know is just a job?  That\u2019s great, but what does that mean? It\u2019s just paying the bills. If I could do that there and have a whole new experience, then, I\u2019d pick that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: What if you could have a job in the Creative Writing Department at [either place] (sp)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Oh, that\u2019s tough. Secretly, my plan is to be the guy that heads that up. If that\u2019s their plan to get that going in the next few years, who\u2019s going to be there? If I go and they like me and I know all these people and I\u2019m qualified\u2026 that\u2019s pretty awesome. It\u2019s a university, so it\u2019s like teaching <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">in the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">That\u2019s a big deal. I probably prefer that. I would be able to come and go and travel. I\u2019d spend summers here.  There\u2019s a lot I could do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: If you could have the position year-round, do you see yourself as being (inaudible at 00:07:12)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t even been there, so I don\u2019t know. It seems like a good opportunity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">I don\u2019t want to talk to big. What if I get off the plane, and I\u2019m like, \u201cUh, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d That\u2019s why that adjunct (inaudible at 00:07:25) thing is perfect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">The more I look into it, the more I explore the community of Assyrians that have gone there, the things that are happening there\u2026 Things aren\u2019t great here. It\u2019s my town, I love it. Obviously, we have a lot of conveniences. Assyria is a bustling, (inaudible at 00:07:57)\u2026 There\u2019s no instability or weirdness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">It\u2019s shitty for some of the people that live there, obviously. There\u2019s poverty, but there\u2019s poverty here, too. Over there, I can understand it \u2013 here? It\u2019s all relative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">My feeling is I\u2019d rather go and see. What\u2019s the worst? \u201cI can\u2019t do it; I\u2019m just going to come back.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s going from a place of being interested enough that that could be where you want to live.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: That it\u2019s worth pursuing, all things being equal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Not just going (inaudible at 00:08:42) because that\u2019s the only opportunity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: No. It\u2019s a big move, just for the opportunity. Especially when \u2013 let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not a huge \u2013 it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going because I\u2019m going to work in the Middle East, where I\u2019m going to make a lot of dollars. It\u2019s not one of those types of moves, where I\u2019ll suck it up but I\u2019m going to make <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">a lot of money for two years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">I\u2019ll be okay. If rent\u2019s $500 and I\u2019m making $4,300 per course\u2026 What I\u2019m saying, though, is everyone I\u2019ve talked to is like\u2014I\u2019m asking people, \u201cWhat does this mean? When should I come?\u201d Obviously, I need to be there before August. Should I just show in March and there\u2019s going to be work? Everyone\u2019s like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200771\">\u201cDude, yeah. There\u2019s stuff.

You\u2019re published, you\u2019re this, you\u2019re that, you\u2019ve done\u2026 You\u2019re a gift to them. They want people like you. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be a cakewalk.

It\u2019s not that I\u2019m not going to miss them, but already the last year, two, three, four\u2026  I see them <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED1\">when I see them.

That\u2019s great, but I\u2019m not even interested. If I was, I\u2019d be pursuing it a lot more by getting shows.  I don\u2019t give <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD1\">a shit. It\u2019s the same old people doing the same old shit. A lot of them aren\u2019t particularly talented.

Also, this idea that because I look back on things that I\u2019m so disconcerted because of \u2013 what did you say? An integrated memory or whatever? It\u2019s not integrated, so when I look back \u2013 even on memories I have here \u2013 I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s weird.

I have weird memories like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">I think that\u2019s why this idea of being here but also\u2014or being somewhere else but just coming back very often, that\u2019s it\u2019s home and I\u2019m here often, but I don\u2019t\u2026 At least, for a while, I think maybe that\u2019s what needs to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D\">THERAPIST: You mean having this space to then (inaudible at 00:32:52).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">CLIENT: Right, because that way, I could come back.
