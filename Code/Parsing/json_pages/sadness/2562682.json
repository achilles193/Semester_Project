(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">I guess I\u2019m thinking about our talk from Monday about profound experiences versus I guess shallow ones. {Laughter} I guess I feel like lately I realized how nice it is to have shallow experiences. {Laughter} I\u2019m not spending as much time, or all my time, with Chris. {Laughter} Not to say that he\u2019s always <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">deep. I feel like he is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">He\u2019s always thinking words in his head, but he does, you know, cook and shower and shave. (pause) Yeah. I guess having people with whom I have shallow experiences, they seem, at first when I\u2019ve just met them, it\u2019s like I have the same anxiety that I have every time I meet someone new. Oh, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">Like, when I am going to get to have, to get close to them and have a heart to heart or whatever and be really close and stuff? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">But, I guess, consistently seeing them just for fun is more like and now I feel like I need those people because (pause) yeah, I mean, once you keep having light things with them you don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t know. Maybe that\u2019s not true. Do you know what I mean? Generally, you don\u2019t want to share dark <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">things with them. (silence from 00:07:45 to 00:08:35)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">I mean, when you meet people you work out with you don\u2019t necessarily . I guess I\u2019m imagining people thinking oh, I don\u2019t want to share everything. I don\u2019t want to cry in front of my work out buddy, I guess. You know? I want to keep that relationship light or I don\u2019t know. I mean it\u2019s okay to share <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">more important things with work out buddies. I guess I feel like maybe that\u2019s how people think that they have to have separate friends for separate needs. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">I also sometimes wonder some of the people that I\u2019ve met through Nelson (sp?), how would I have met them? How would I have gained friends if it weren\u2019t him? Then I think I guess I could have hung out more with my school friends, but then I\u2019m like I see myself riding trains everywhere or walking a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">and wasting a lot of time doing that getting from place to place thing to hang out with them. Then I imagine trying to connect with them, but not really connecting and then again, I guess in light of our recent conversations, me thinking of what is this ideal connection that I have? That if I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">get it, I feel like, well that was a total bust. That was bad. That was horrible. You know? {Laughter} <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">I met this guy from school for coffee and we had a decent conversation about art and stuff and I guess we met later that evening and I, my friend, another friend from school, she drinks a lot. So, she, I had to drink a little bit with her and I was a little buzzed. I walked, the guy joined us and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">I ended up walking him home and I was thinking that was funny because I was one that was buzzed, so he should have walked me home. Then, as I was walking home, I fell. {Laughter} <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">I was thinking and I was just laughing at this experience. I was wondering, I wonder if earlier I would have thought I would have been really scared of this experience. You know? Living here by myself or getting drunk and walking home alone and falling. I wonder if those, these things would be on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">list of the things that I\u2019m supposed to be scared of, but I\u2019m really not. So, yeah, I mean I\u2019m just wondering. I fear, every time, I\u2019ve avoided for so many years, I\u2019ve avoided doing this. Getting all of these e-mails about readings and about hang outs and never going to a single one of them because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">they\u2019re in Augusta. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562682\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">I\u2019m like well, it\u2019s just going to take my whole evening away and I\u2019d rather just sit and ride or I don\u2019t. I just stay at home. I guess do something with others or with people in Providence. One time I did go out to Aurora and attended a reading and then later on went and had drinks and had a fine time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">So, I\u2019m just wondering. I guess I should have done more of that. I was wondering what exactly I was afraid of. I mean I guess it\u2019s a valid concern because if I have homework or I want to finish something, then having a bit more dedication and saying no to things is fine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">Saying no to them because of some stupid, nameless fear of not getting the connection that I desire is kind of bogus I feel now. I guess that\u2019s kind of my fear anyways. I feel like people at my school, I tell myself oh, I should be afraid of them because they\u2019re Americans and I don\u2019t get a lot of their <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">references which is silly because some of my closest friends are Americans. I feel way more judged in the company of Indians than I do being with the Americans. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">There are different standards and values and stuff. Yeah. (pause) I wonder if I can just like tell myself I\u2019m just looking for a shallow experience and then if the experience is better than shallow and is deeper, then I would be pleasantly surprised. {Laughter} I guess that\u2019s why I find it funny to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">be with Nelson or just be seeing him after all these months because I wasn\u2019t expecting much. I think I was expecting drinks on Fridays and that\u2019s it. Everything was a surprise, a pleasant surprise. Being able to talk to him and then meeting his friends and stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">I wonder if that is the approach I should take. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything. I\u2019m just sad like oh, I don\u2019t expect much. I feel like it\u2019s, I mean it is less intense and I wonder if I can live with being less intense. I mean I guess that could be a more positive way of looking it rather than just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">oh, I\u2019ve lowered my standards or I don\u2019t expect that much from anyone. I guess I could look at it more like I\u2019m not going to hold people to the gun or myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s definitely a balance between taking anything because you\u2019re expecting nothing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: And being chronically disappointed and frustrated and angry because you expect so much. I do agree that you do error, at least some of the time, on expecting to have such high expectations that you chronically feel disappointed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Maybe sort of the compromise is open mindedness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m trying to be open minded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you are. It very much sounds like you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, this new thing has come up in my head. This might open Pandora\u2019s box. {Laughter} How did it come up? I have to think about how it came up because the context is important. I can\u2019t remember exactly now. Never mind. I\u2019ll just ask you. Nelson was kind of, I don\u2019t know. I think he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">changing and suddenly he started to do a strip, a pretend strip tease or something. I was laughing at him and I don\u2019t know how it came up, but he said something about going to a strip club or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562682\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">I was like have you been to a strip club and he said yeah, of course and then I was like, that just totally made me gawk and I was like really? I was just so surprised because I guess I felt really weird about it. Having read feminist theory and stuff and I felt totally like that\u2019s the wrong thing to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">do. The women there have no choice in the matter and their occupational hazards are horrible. It\u2019s like really immoral to do that sort of thing. Plus, the fact that I have that whole baggage about my dad being like that and my mom just being so miserable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Being like that meaning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: He was very, I don\u2019t know. Maybe instead of using adjectives, I\u2019ll just say what he used to do. He used to watch a lot of porn and sleep around a lot. I think all of this came out just during the last year of my college. My mom was really, really traumatized and was thinking of leaving him. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">This was also in the context of us all going to church and stuff. Yeah. She was really traumatized. She was very. She bottled it all up for like 20 years and never told me anything about his behavior, but it all kind of slowly started coming out or very quickly came out, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">She was like they\u2019re going to Atlantic City and at that time my boyfriend was like what the fuck is that? This man gambles and sleeps around and you and your mom takes him to Atlantic City. I was like her reasoning is that if you\u2019re, you have a hunger a for something and you\u2019re taken to a buffet of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">that thing, then you\u2019ll just over saturate yourself and not do that ever again. So, whatever. That year I was just like so fucking I could have, if I could have killed my parents, I would have. I mean look at the things that they were doing. Borrowing money from me and stealing my money and all of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200492\">that. I felt so embarrassed in front of Jeremy who is so well put together in comparison to all this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">Anyway. So, I mean I guess my mom was telling me about the trip much later how horrified. She was crying and she said there were naked women in front of me and that kind of, that just stayed with me. Her crying and saying that and feeling so vulnerable and hopeless and lost and hoping he would change <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">and he would never again. It just stayed with me. It still lives in my head and I wish I could be exercised of that because I associate all of that, strip clubs, with feeling that way. Like, my mom with her open hair and trying to look pretty for my dad. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just like it\u2019s, they\u2019re in there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">I don\u2019t know what it feels like to be that old and having a bad marriage and trying to ignite something. I don\u2019t know. Anyway. Going back to, sorry, I\u2019m talking about going to strip clubs. Yeah. I just was, I got so scared. Just like so scared thinking and imagining him looking at other women who have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">far more tone and gorgeous bodies or whatever. Me feeling like my mom. I mean, like fuck, I don\u2019t want to feel that way. You know? I don\u2019t want to be that woman. I don\u2019t want to be that way. I talked to another guy friend about strip clubs and he was like yeah, I\u2019ve been. He was just laughing and this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">was over the phone, so he couldn\u2019t see my expression or anything. Well, you know, I\u2019m listening and he was like yeah, I\u2019ve been thrown out of strip clubs and this and that. { Laughter} <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562682\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">You know, that\u2019s the thing you do when you, the moment you get to the US. Then last night I talked to Chris about it too and he was like yeah, I\u2019ve been to one [] and I\u2019m like you? You have been to a strip club? He was like no, but, you know I was so embarrassed about it and this and that. Then he sees <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">things the way that I see them and he\u2019s says that these women are exploited and they\u2019d rather not do this. He wasn\u2019t being, I don\u2019t think he was not being moral. He was not taking a moral stance. He just didn\u2019t have all that fucking baggage that I do about my dad and my mom about the strip club or whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F2\">You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">I guess I brought this up in the context of trying to be more open minded and I guess not as judgmental. Even just imagining my boyfriend or my lover or my husband at a strip club and being okay with that. You know? I guess the friend that I was talking to on the phone, he was like I\u2019ll take you to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">one and I was like you know what? Yeah. You know, let\u2019s just face that fucking fear that I have. Let\u2019s just see one and what it\u2019s going to be like. Maybe I will break down and cry. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s that thing that\u2019s in my head for so long that I\u2019m so afraid of. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">Maybe that\u2019s one reason why I am petrified of American highways. I just have that association of truck drivers at night and then those signs that say gentleman\u2019s club or whatever. I imagine them stopping and these women being exploited. Then somewhere inside my mom who is like, who used to be Indian <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">and had all these Indian cultural associations to completely not having any of that and just being lost and I don\u2019t know. Again, it\u2019s a picture. It\u2019s static. { Laughter} (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">Yeah, I mean I guess it\u2019s, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve not articulated this, but maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. The things that my mom could not do, maybe I could in the sense of betrayal and marriage. Not necessarily betrayal. I don\u2019t know. I thought my dad is this way and I tried to subconsciously pick <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">a man who was completely the opposite. Not as chauvinistic or masculine. I\u2019m not calling Chris effeminate, but yet his masculinity may be much more nuances. It\u2019s more like theoretical. It has a theoretical base, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: Your father\u2019s masculinity, in part, is somewhat predatory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah? In what way? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Predatory sounds a little too malevolent. I don\u2019t see your father as the malevolent type predator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: Oh, he was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: Would you call him a predator?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. He would be, he could, when he was younger, he was very proud of the fact that he could seduce any woman he wanted. Later on in life, it became very upsetting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: Would he brag about that to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: As much as he could to a ten year old, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: How?

Something like that. { Laughter}<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562682\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: So, predatory is accurate?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s sort of different ways of thinking about masculinity and types of masculinity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: That version of masculinity amidst certain places is predatory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it\u2019s always my fear. Will I end up with someone like my dad? I don\u2019t want to. I mean I guess I\u2019m trying. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I should say that that was his appeal to my mom. I don\u2019t think so. Yeah. I mean I don\u2019t know if Nelson is predatory. I don\u2019t think he is. I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">I guess this is in the context of being open. It\u2019s like how much more open can I get? I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m thinking I shouldn\u2019t freak out if my boyfriend goes or has been to a strip club. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">I guess our first date was almost a strip club. It was a burlesque show.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Where was it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: At some club in D.C. I can\u2019t remember the name. I didn\u2019t think the world had come crashing down. I guess at that time I didn\u2019t really know. I didn\u2019t really interpret him looking at that as oh. Why do you think my mom was so saddened by that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: By?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Traumatized by that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: My dad going to such places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: What do you think it could be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It seems like you can relate to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to be like that\u2019s strange behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s strange? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m losing you. What strange behavior? Your mother relating to it or your dad? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. My mom being traumatized by that. I want to say that I find it strange.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: That she was traumatized that he went to strip clubs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. I guess probably a lot of women don\u2019t want their husbands frequenting strip clubs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Why do people ride against it? Why do women\u2019s fears ride against it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: They do because it\u2019s like those women are exploited. I doubt that my mom has a bit of, I mean she doesn\u2019t wish them ill, but I doubt she has their good in her heart when she\u2019s like don\u2019t do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">I guess. I mean I don\u2019t know. She thinks of him looking at other women as him not finding her attractive anymore or I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Why do men do it? {Laughter} I don\u2019t know if I have the urge to go to like male strip clubs. You know, like, a strip club for women. I don\u2019t want to be traumatized <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">by men doing it. You know? Apparently, every guy I know or I\u2019m close with has been to one. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: It seems to me different. That there\u2019s a difference between someone going once or a couple times to frequenting one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: It seems like a big difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. That is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: It seems like one is sort of curiosity or interest and the other is kind of something habitual or addictive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: But it does make you anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t really want to be because it\u2019s got nothing to do with me. You know? I mean it\u2019s their sexuality. It\u2019s their kind of their way of getting sexual stimulation. If it isn\u2019t mine, then mine might be something else. As long as they\u2019re not judging me, I shouldn\u2019t be judging them. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562682\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">That\u2019s the theory part, which is a separate matter. The morality of what it means to work at a strip club is, I guess, a separate part. I guess some men say that it\u2019s admiring female beauty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: It also makes me think about our conversations about relationships as transactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (silence from 00:35:35 to 00:36:35) I guess I\u2019m trying, I\u2019m starting to feel and see things differently about that. Like, I was talking to Nelson once and he was like at the end of the day, who am I with? Who do I come back to? I was like, it was weird the way he phrased that sentence. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">As though he frequents strip clubs and then comes to me. Neither of those two things are true. We don\u2019t live together. He doesn\u2019t frequent, I hope. I don\u2019t know. I guess I thought about what he said and what happens at a strip club, that is transactional. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">I guess what happens between him and me I guess is not in that meaning or by that logic that it\u2019s meaningful or even if it\u2019s not meaningful at certain times, I don\u2019t get the profound interaction that I\u2019m hoping for. It\u2019s still there, but it\u2019s not transactional. You know? Do you know what I\u2019m saying? <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B91\">It\u2019s meaningful. It\u2019s meaningless. I\u2019m not meaningless. Not as meaningful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Not everything that\u2019s not intensely connective is transactional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Which is, I guess, when people say I have invested in you or I\u2019m investing in this relationship, I guess that also doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s transactional. { Laughter} It could because it\u2019s the same kind of, you know, monetary reference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: It depends on what they\u2019re investing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, but like you invest time and you get back time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: But, if you\u2019re investing in yourself as a person, I don\u2019t see that as transactional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: It seems like one of the big differences between a relationship that\u2019s sort of a genuine one versus serving a transaction is whether you value that person for them as a person or as the function they serve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, that\u2019s a bit harder to distinguish, I think. I mean everyone serves a purpose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s true. They\u2019re fulfilling a need, but I guess, so that\u2019s true. You\u2019re seeking them out because you have a need. If you got in them simply for their utility and not who they are. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. I guess as a writer I just feel, I see that as people have their purposes and you love them for who they are, but who they are is a question in the universe. Their answer to the question. Investing is more like growing a tree or planting a tree. You don\u2019t necessarily, I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">you have the hope of eating the fruit at some point, but it\u2019s a gamble. You don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to grow or what will happen. So many things are out of your control. You invest because at that time, that\u2019s what you want to do with your time and energy and money. At that point it makes you feel good <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD2\">and then over time you realize that that little investment is like a big tree now and something you can depend on. That\u2019s not transactional. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">I guess my mom, I don\u2019t know, I guess she just didn\u2019t get what she wanted. { Laughter} I know that\u2019s transactional. I guess that\u2019s the root cause of her dissatisfaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: How do you mean she didn\u2019t get what she wanted?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562682\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: She didn\u2019t get, I mean she wanted my dad to be around and to get a job and be a proper husband and he never did that. Instead he wasted time in meaningless interactions, transactions, you know. She did love him profoundly, but he just wasn\u2019t able to love her back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: You saw that in her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: What do you think that love was about? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. A lot of things. Their own needs. Also, the need to be needed. The need to take care of him. Genuine attraction and chemistry and knowing someone for so long and feeling like she\u2019s the only one who understands him and everyone else thinks he\u2019s a douche bag. Then, over time, sharing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB1\">life. Sharing profound experiences. Mostly most of them are negative. Their marriage was a complete mess. That\u2019s my take on it anyway. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">I just don\u2019t want to be as traumatized by it as I am. You know? I want to let go of it and be like it doesn\u2019t make me sad anymore, but it has for a very long time. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Their relationship. Your mom\u2019s feelings about your dad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Your feelings about your dad and all of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: It was a very traumatic experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just don\u2019t want it to be that much. Not anymore.
