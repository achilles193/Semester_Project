So it went well. The actual surgery went really well, evidently, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: That's a relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yes. [laughs] She's very relieved that it's over and now, when the 28th rolls around, she'll be in so much better shape, then, so that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Now what, along those lines? She just waits and do some follow-up to see if they got everything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Right. Yes. That's pretty much it. I think he was going to do another biopsy, maybe. (inaudible at 00:00:39) I know he took some samples, I believe, during the surgery and they're waiting on those results, so, hopefully, hopefully it's all gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">Yeah, it's a really nice doctor and a really nice anesthesiologist, and it's good, overall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: You talked to both of them? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Like, sitting in the waiting room, they would come out, you mean (crosstalk at 00:01:06)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, the doctor came out in the waiting room, but I also was in pre-op with her, so met both of them then, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Your (inaudible at 00:01:13) wasn't?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: No. [sighs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yes! (crosstalk at 00:01:18)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, he missed seeing her at the hospital before she went in. They did take her in, I don't know, 25 minutes early, but... He was away, because he had a conference. He had a three-day continuing-ed conference. Though he at least went that morning to sign in, and he said he didn't know he would-I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">don't think he ever did, like, that day, get to go back. On Saturday, he spent most of the day there. I guess he'd gone on Thursday.  But yeah, he said-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:02:02) Saturday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Friday, Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: [sighs] So he was there while she was in surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Thursday, Saturday...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: It's Thursday, Friday, Saturday conference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: And so Friday, he went in the morning to sign in, at least. And then-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: And missed her going in surgery. And he was there Thursday, at the conference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right, right. I mean, no, he needed to be there all three days, and I don't think he ended up actually (inaudible at 00:02:29) in the conference, which is problematic, but it sounded like he had let it go to the last minute and getting close to the deadline for the year's continuing-ed credits, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">so it's a mess. It's the same thing as usual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">But Emma and I were both there with her, and he was there while she was in surgery and then when she woke up and everything.  [sighs] Didn't see much of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Then he wasn't there Saturday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: We went last morning, because she was supposed to be discharged in the morning, but then actually it wasn't until, what, 8:30 at night that we were finally able to take her? Because her calcium was low, and that's a common thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">Anyway, he came with us. Drove separately again and stayed very briefly, and then went to his conference. Then after he went to the conference, he did some emergencies. He vaccinated some animals for some kind of fair that was coming up. Some things that maybe someone else could have done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">This is how it's always been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Even the conference, there are online things you can do for CE credit (crosstalk at 00:03:54).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561754\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I don't know. Yeah, I really don't know, for him. And this was in his specialty that they had, but it sounded like there were other conferences that had-this wasn't the only conference, [laughs] (inaudible at 00:04:07) it sounded like he waited until the last minute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">So that's kind of how it goes, I guess. Then Friday night, he didn't show up at home until a little after 10:00, whatever, at night. He just kept going. [laughs] It's just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: You're used to this (crosstalk at 00:04:26)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I'm very used to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: I don't think you know how extreme it is, because you're so used to it, you know what I mean (crosstalk at 00:04:37)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: I mean, I get that that's not normal and it's not healthy, that I don't think I'm as shocked or worked-up about it as someone else would be, because was always been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">But I felt so horrible, because only one person could go with her into actual pre-op until right before OR, so I went, because Emma's not as comfortable with needles and stuff, and anyway, it was fine. [0:05:00] But she was really worked-up really, really, really worked-up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">It was difficult, because throughout the weekend, a lot, when he was there, when he wasn't there, she would just make comments about him, and would say things like, \"Can you please talk to your dad? He's home at midnight, he leaves by 7:00 in the morning, I never see him, he's never home\"-it's such <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">a difficult situation to be put in the middle of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Oh, it's horrible! And it's none of her business!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: No, it's not. I really do understand what that feels like, I really did live did with that. I know she's not making it up, she's not exaggerating, I'm sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Then you turn to someone else besides your daughters to talk about that. A therapist, a friend...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: It's difficult. When she asked me to talk to him, I really feel like I want to, because it bothers me, too. He's now 59, he's too old to be doing this crazy-having this crazy lifestyle all the time. It's hard, when she says stuff like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">When he came to her at the-when we saw her back in her room, she was like, \"Oh, Barry, I haven't seen you in months.\" It's really difficult, because it's hard to-I don't condone it, I don't think that what he's doing is okay, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: How are they together when they are together? Do they get along?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I hear that kind of cutting comment. They're not otherwise friendly? What is it like when they're (crosstalk at 00:06:36)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: They are friendly if he is doing something actively for her. Otherwise, it's pretty much not-this is horrible, but my mom is very, very critical of him. These are a lot of valid points. In front of us, especially, it feels like she frequently tries to really embarrass him and put him down and... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">She said stuff to us like, \"Well, one of these times, of course, he'll fall asleep while he's driving.\" Stuff like that. His favorite place to sleep is at the fast food restaurant down the road, he falls asleep there, he takes a nap-lots of things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">Emma pointed out, it's not always just to us. There were nurses that she was complaining about him to, even cutting comments. It's really, really hard to-it's not her fault that he's a workaholic, but I do think that it's not totally coincidental that he's not home, because I don't think anyone could <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">take that all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561754\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:07:47) avoiding her too, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: It's a complicated... And she says how alone she is, but it's difficult-it's not okay that my dad's never home and that's not helpful to either of them, I'm sure, ultimately, but [0:08:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: But she's not acting in such a way that would make him want to come home more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: No, and maybe that's not her responsibility to make him come-I don't know. It feels like she could socialize. She could get out. There are people who've tried. She does have some friends. She does... It's really a tough, tough situation, and it's been this way for so long, and... [sighs] It <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">just really [laughs] is a difficult weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">We got back at 11:45 last night. We got in at 2:00 a.m. on Friday, we finally got in. And then we had to get up [laughs] at 6:15. We had not gone to bed before 3:00 and it was really crazy, the long weekend. We spent pretty much Friday and Saturday at the hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">As rotten as it kind of was, it was good, in a sense, because I really felt kind of worked-up. I kept thinking if I had spent the day at home, if she had been home, I probably would have taken care of a million things, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You think you were prevented almost from doing that by being (00:09:03) at the hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Right. So, anyway, I guess she's doing a little better. I did feel bad, because before we left, Sunday morning, we did some things. We made her some food, we made her some meals, she'd asked if we could vacuum the stairs so I vacuumed the stairs. Taking care of the pets [laughs] all the pets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">She needed to walk, so I said, \"Let's go walk out the lane.\" My parents live back in the country so they got a lane instead of a driveway. We did that, but it was really tough, because she was saying how she feels-asked her how she felt, \"Oh, I feel really insecure. Your dad's not here, and now you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">leaving.\" I felt horrible. I wanted to say [laughs], \"Emma, can't you take off tomorrow? Can't we stay longer?\" But any amount of time wouldn't have been long enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: And she's still not seeing that (inaudible at 00:09:57)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: She had mentioned that she might be interested in a support group, so I really encouraged that.  Because it seems like she wants to talk about it. She asks if we're ashamed to tell people that she has cancer. She feels ashamed that she has-I don't know if she really does or if she's looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">for a way to introduce the topic, like she needs to talk about it. [sighs] It's difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">I encouraged her, I said, \"The support group might be really great.\" The pastor from the church that she has sometimes gone to is-I know she would be willing to talk to her or spend time with her, even on the phone or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">I felt out of line, but I did say, \"Do you have someone to help you, anyone to feel down around this? And I know you struggled with that, aside from-this would be especially tough. Do you have someone to help you with some depression?\" I felt out of line saying that, but I felt no one else was going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">to say it and I felt it was important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:11:02)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: It's difficult, because it's such a sensitive topic.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561754\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: In fact, she said, \"Oh, when I talk like this, it's my dad in me.\" Almost like it's his fault that she... I said, \"No, it's okay to have it and to work on it.\" I said, \"Do you need help finding someone? I'd be happy to help you find someone.\" She was seeing but this person isn't licensed and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">not covered by Medicare. I said, \"Well...\" [sighs] There's a small practice in town and they're all licensed, and I said, \"Why don't you look into that?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Call them, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: I said, \"You could at least try it.\" So I don't know, but I felt... It's hard, because going home, really want to make my dad come home and make my mom go talk to someone and get help with depression, and make her get out some.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">But, overall, I think it went well and she was very grateful that we were there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: And I know; I hear that you want to make them do these things. I still think, Ramona, you're saying, \"You need to see someone, Mom. Here's a practice, why don't you call? Yes, go to the support group,\" is a healthier kind of intervention for you to be having, even with some hope, even though <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">you know it's not likely she's going to follow through on any of these things, then you're getting pulled into feeling like you have to cure her depression somehow. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Maybe. [sighs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Whether it works or not probably won't work. But it's still you saying, \"This isn't actually my responsibility\" to cure her. She needs help and there are professional people who could help her with what's going inside her and it's not your job. It is help to offer and try to help her get <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">in and encroach her to get in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">You might even get tired of doing that, but that's a much healthier place for you, as a daughter, to be in, than feeling like you somehow could do something, like fix the house somehow, or if only you asked her the right question, or let her see the light in the conversation that everything would change. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\"> It's not going to change from that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">And there's a little bit of you saying, \"Here are the things that could help,\" and actually, it's not you that's going to be that helpful with the long-run, deep stuff no matter how hard you try, no matter how many extra days you add on to being there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: It was hard to leave. But I guess I felt proud, a little bit, of myself, because I-in the moment, in the session when you said, \"Take a walk, ask yourself if it's your responsibility to do these things, go out, go do something with your sister,\" that felt so... Not to put any judgment on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">advice, but it felt so-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I want to hear it. [laughs] No, I want to know how it felt!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: In my own experience, it felt so, I don't know. Not inadequate, but taking a walk is...  [laughs] Taking a walk is not going to-it felt like it's hard to explain what it's really like. It's such a dramatic word, but it feels like a trauma and it feels like revisiting the trauma and it feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">so-the dynamic and everything that goes on, it's so intense and it's so triggering, for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">And so, the thought of taking a walk or stopping and saying, \"Is this my responsibility?\" felt like it wouldn't begin to-it's like a Band-Aid on a really major thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">But, [laughs] in the heat of it-so my mom had done some stuff. A lot of it was the typical rearranging furniture, displaying her Hummel collection, switching out the curio cabinet, things like that. The floor isn't clean at all. That's the way it's always been, but at least that shows some motivation <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">and some... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561754\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">And so anyway, in some senses, it felt even harder, because I thought, \"Here, she's really trying. If I helped her, it would be even better,\" as opposed to, \"If she's not trying, it doesn't (inaudible at 00:15:10).\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">I did catch myself when we got in; I guess it was Friday when we finally got back in the evening. Emma and I were just completely exhausted, and the downstairs, the table wasn't cleared off. It was a mess. It was a mess. So Emma and I made some pasta, whatever, and we had to make a second box because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B11\">it was out-of-date. It was over a year out-of-date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">Maybe [laughs] that could happen to anyone, but it felt like my parents are older, they're not taking care of themselves, they're not-I don't know. For whatever reason, a couple of out-of-date food items really upset me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">But we finally made some food and I said, \"Why don't we go upstairs? I'm getting worked up. I don't want to look at this. I just can't right now.\"  And so I did! Went up to my room, which was nice and the way I left it, more or less she moved some furniture in that she didn't have room for, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">So we did. And we just did it because we were too exhausted, we could not. It was okay. And because we spent so much time in the hospital, we didn't really have the option. But, early Saturday morning, I thought, \"Okay.\" The pets need some care and I thought, \"Is it my responsibility? No.\" But then <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">I thought, no matter what, if I had the perfect home life, and my parents had pets and mom went in to get surgery, I would take care of all the pets, anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Absolutely, absolutely!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: So I thought, \"That's not so terrible.\" So I cleaned all the cat litters, took care of all the... And then Sunday morning, Emma took care of all the birds. And we cooked her soup, that she would have a big thing of homemade soup for the week, and I made her breakfast and stuff. She had specifically <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">asked, \"Could someone clean the stairs?\"  So I got them vacuumed. I didn't get more done but I thought, \"That's okay.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">And I took some time, there were a couple things that I had at home that I wanted to clean up and bring back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: For yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: And so I thought, \"That's okay.\" I got some of that done. It was okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: In fact, that, too might happen if the (crosstalk at 00:17:23)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Right!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:17:25) really clean and sort of ordinary. That's all within range of ordinary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: It was really, really difficult, because I thought, \"This floor is so dirty. I've got to at least mop this and put down some rugs. I've got to do this.\" And I didn't get to it and it wasn't the end of the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">It kind of occurred to me, in a strange way, I think trying to figure it out on my own, but I thought maybe it's sometimes so important to me that it's done. Maybe part of that is because I associate those things being done with them putting us first, or prioritizing that we're taken care of.  It's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB1\">so much in my childhood growing up there. I always felt that if the meals are made or if the house was clean, that that would be a reflection of that. I understand that that's not what it is, but I think even if, in a very strange way, if it gets done, I still have a little bit of that relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561754\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: You end up feeling loved and taken care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: Even if they're not doing it, the outcome is still what I would be looking for from them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: That's so interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: It makes a lot of sense (crosstalk at 00:18:39)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: [laughs] It might be very random, but I do realize it's more important to me, probably, than to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And what we were talking about before you left was how important it was to managing your anxiety, but you're adding, even to managing, you're feeling taken care of and loved, in a way. That even as a kid, maybe there's a way the house being clean became this kind of concrete, symbolic <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D91\">demonstration of whether you were loved or not.  Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: It gets conflated with something else. In other words, there are people who grow up in brand spanking, perfectly clean houses, where the parents are obsessively clean, and there's no love at all, right? There are times where people grow up in a barn, and it's constantly like a barn, and there's <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">so much love that that doesn't become that important, either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">I think in your feeling like that became for some reason the way it felt to you, there could be an expression of something loving, of putting you first. That's what you're saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: I think, too, because in the hospital, my mom, she-I can't even tell you, she talked about the pets non-stop. \"Are they okay?\" One of the first questions out of her mouth, \"Did Jessie,\" this really old cat that she adopted, she found on the street literally, \"Is she okay? Did she get her special <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">food? Did she get her this, did she get her that?\"  Asking about all of them. That's normal. Between her and my dad, it occurred to me that so much of the time animals come first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Why does the attention go to the animals?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: And it's not that-I mean, I love animals and it's great that they care for them, but it's like 20 pets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Sometimes it feels like at the cost of the more (crosstalk at 00:20:24)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: It's been at the cost of even what's good for them, which drives my dad to be out until midnight, which drives her to... I talked to her briefly, this morning, to see how she's doing. \"Oh, I took care of the cat litters.\" That's fine, but why is-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:20:38) crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: [laughs] Right. It's too much. I don't know. It's hard. But I guess it's so bizarre, and I think I made it up completely that I felt a little good that when I went to change the cat litters, they were really bad. But I noticed she had done some stuff around the house.  When we got in, one of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED1\">the first things she said was, \"I went until I couldn't go anymore.\" She had done some housework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">A part of me had this fantasy, maybe the cat litters were actually neglected for a couple days. Maybe she really did clean up a little bit for us to come home. It sounds strange in the circumstances, that I would-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:21:23), no, I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: It's almost like what if we finally-I don't know, it's a really difficult weekend. But, she's doing well, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200F2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561754\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: On many levels. And some things that you did that were a little bit different from your first time (crosstalk at 00:21:44) feel proud of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Do you get my e-mail back to (crosstalk at 00:21:49)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: No, I did, and I had a chance to read it but I never had a chance to respond.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Which is totally fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: I was not home at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: I know you were busy this weekend, of course. I just wanted to make sure you read it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: No, and I appreciated it.  I think it's true, what you said. I am deeply furious with my parents and there's no way for it to come out at this-I don't know what to do with that. And deeply disappointed, I think is the phrase you used and it is true. And I am aware sometimes that I am irritable <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201031\">when these types of situations come up, because when I go home, it's so important to put together, to not be emotional, to be completely responsible, to take care of everything, to let all those comments no matter how hurtful they might be about me or my dad or anyone just let them go and keep going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: And the buttoned-up, everything tightly under wraps, and then sometimes being irritated is your protection, I think. And I think that's what you were saying, that, \"I can't. You don't understand. Why would I start letting myself feel right now?\" You have to protect yourself and prepare for this weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: It doesn't feel possible, if that makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah. No, it does make sense. It's so ingrained in you. And yet, a little of something became possible. That's where I think that there's a little, little bit by little bit, there might be little room to do something that surprises you maybe even that you hadn't intended but all of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201091\">sudden, you find yourself doing something different and it's okay. It's not the end of the world, you said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">I also want to say that, just to be clear, I wasn't trying to say that it was only your projection onto me of your being frustrated at your parents and disappointed, because I think you might have been. You're saying this to me, what it felt like in the moment as we were talking was, \"Really? Go for <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">a walk? Do I not understand\" (crosstalk at 00:23:47)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">CLIENT: Which isn't fair, because it was helpful to take a breather... Emma and I sat in the courtyard at the hospital, sometimes, because it was really hard to listen to some of that for hours on end. It was somewhat helpful advice, but in the moment, it felt so... it felt like a Band-Aid. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">THERAPIST: I get it. And it didn't feel like it could really touch the level of trauma you were walking back into.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">That's where I again want to clarify, I can understand that. And there might even been a way that I didn't use the right language, that if I'd used a slightly-different language, you would feel that I understood it better, do you know what I mean? It's not only projection, in other words, there may <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201111\">be something that I was missing in the way I was talking about it that might have actually felt and been invalidating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">I think, for example, I didn't use the language that is inside me, that I didn't say it out loud, that this truly is trauma for you, Ramona. And when I say something like, \"Talk a walk,\" it isn't meant to say like that's all it is. When I'm actually was speaking to him, rattling off this quick list <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201131\">of things that seem sort of benign and silly on the surface, is trying to develop more of a protective barrier between you and the trauma of returning to your home. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20112-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20112-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561754\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">I would speak to you about this if we were even talking about someone who had physically abused you as a child, and you felt you had to go home to see them, right? Sometimes people, they can't keep (inaudible at 00:25:21). How do you develop more of a safety zone, for yourself, so that you have some <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201151\">space not to get totally pulled back into being right back in the trauma, doing what you did as a little girl and letting yourself get treated that (inaudible at 000:25:35)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">So that's, I think, what taking a walk is about, or getting to lunch with your sister it's sort of like finding safe zones where you are protected. You find your adult self and you protect yourself, even if it's for an hour. Even if it is a Band-Aid an hour of protection then bleeding out is better <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201171\">than none at all, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">It of course doesn't touch the depths of this, but it's sort of about how do we get through this weekend and minimize the hurt to you, right?  Sometimes, that is about Band-Aids getting (inaudible at 00:26:08) while you come back and we continue to do the long run of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: I think it part of it, too, was maybe my... I don't know if \"fault\" is the right word, but having unrealistic expectations and feeling like seeing you a second time in a week was-I really started to rely [laughs] on you and I really started to feel like, \"I really need to do this. This is really important.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">And almost coming into it with not a rational mindset but almost [laughs] an expectation that everything that's been going on with Ivan, everything that's going on with my parents, everything that's going on with my mom's surgery, everything that's going on with my job search, all of this huge heavy <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D1\">stuff that I walk around, trying to compartmentalize and keep saying that I'm fine, and walking into it here and thinking that in one short session, you were going to have some kind of magic solution with your expertise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">Not to diminish the power of what you can do in a session, but that would be unrealistic, [laughs] no matter who you were. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: I hear you. Of course, of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: That would be (crosstalk at 00:27:05), you can't do that. Not even on the surface. I think I would have felt agitated, regardless, because it's such an agitating situation. And then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: Well, and even letting yourself actually need and want and open yourself up to a second session, you're saying there's this wish, maybe this, somehow, would change everything dramatically. And then it doesn't, and it's such a disappointment. The wish makes so much sense, so much sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">CLIENT: I get that it's not rational. I'm responsible, and I get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">THERAPIST: But the wish is understandable. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: [crying]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: I actually wouldn't call the wish irrational. Who wouldn't wish that adding a second session, or within the first of our sessions of therapy, everything would be all set, right? That's ordinary. That seems actually quite rational thing to wish for. [0:28:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">It doesn't mean it works that way. It's a working through that takes a lot of work, but I get that feeling. That makes a lot of sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2012E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561754\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">I believe you were angry at me, that it didn't do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">CLIENT: I guess I walked out feeling not helped and feeling like there's no way that the advice-almost like, with all your expertise, and I'm thinking, \"Take a walk? This is not going to...\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">And in the end, some of that advice was very helpful. Like I said, I think I had expectations that some of these really huge-maybe not even expectations so much as a need for some relief, because it felt like things kept getting piled on. And I had to keep going and had to keep saying, \"It's fine.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201351\">[laughs] No matter what, I have to keep going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">THERAPIST: So I have a question about that, then. When you become aware of maybe that's where you were, just hoping there would be some answer that would get rid of some of this for you, did you have thoughts or ideas about what you were hoping I would say?  Is there something you were wishing to hear? <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201371\">When you imagine, if I only said this about the weekend, then you would have felt better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">CLIENT: No. I don't think there's any-I think I was maybe looking for more validation about how difficult it is to be so triggered, because I already feel like I'm overreacting when I use the word \"trauma.\" If I feel like the response is, \"Try going for a walk or asking if it's your responsibility,\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201391\">I feel like I'm really overreacting. But inside of me and I don't know if it's right or wrong but I do feel so upset and so worked-up thinking about it and being in the situation. It's really difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">I hear how silly it is to say, \"Oh, it's so hard to not clean those floors,\" or, \"It's so hard to not coax this or that.\"  It sounds really silly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: See, I don't think it sounds silly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: But it's so, I don't know. It's really, really, really, really difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">THERAPIST: I don't actually think it sounds silly at all, Ramona. I think it's interesting, because when we started working together I don't know if you remember my saying, in a number of different ways, how unbelievably traumatic your upbringing was in the story that I'd heard so far and what little <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201411\">I heard at that point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">And you, then, would say, \"Yeah, but I'm used to it,\" and sort of, \"What's the point of going back there? It's not a big deal.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">I don't know that you have taken in, fully, how traumatic an experience your childhood was, in so many different ways. I don't think it's just, for example, that you were crazy over-the-top cleaner, and if only you would have been less clean and less critical, it wouldn't have been so bad.  The reason <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201451\">you were so focused on cleaning because if you were treating something that was very awry in the family. Not in you in your family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">That's been pretty loud and clear to me from the beginning. Maybe you're at a place so you could heard more about that from me, and I wasn't quite picking up on that. Maybe you could have taken in more of that instead of my just easing off and using that language too much. In the beginning, I thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201471\">that made you sort of pull back even further, that I knew to tiptoe around a little bit and not say too much too strongly, because I didn't want to push you away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">Maybe in the face of it, you are aware. Your emotions tell you something. You wouldn't feel like this for no reason, Ramona. People's emotional lives develop for reasons, right? You wouldn't feel this overwhelmed.  You wouldn't feel like, \"I can't not clean,\" for no reason, right? That comes from somewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20148-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20148-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561754\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">You're discovering even your own self, it comes from this feeling of trying to create feeling loved by two parents.

I want to use almost the word \"purified\" or \"cleansed\" or \"good.\" It feels more bearable. It feels like it's easier.

I've been trying to shove it to the back of my mind for the weekend, because I just couldn't, but he didn't call. And he didn't call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">THERAPIST: The whole time you were down there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">CLIENT: He left my mom one voice-mail, evidently. But he never called me. He sent a couple of texts and that was it. He never even really was, \"How did it go? I want to talk,\" he just didn't.  He just didn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">THERAPIST: How do you understand that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">CLIENT: I asked him, when I got home last night, \"You never called. No matter what we were dealing with, I know whose fault it was, I don't understand why you couldn't even drop that for the weekend to call. This was not a routine thing. This is a really, really big deal, and really, really difficult for my family.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">He said, \"Well, I got some terse responses to the couple of texts that I did send.\" And I said, \"Yeah, I did send you short answers when you asked if I'm going to be home on Sunday, I only answered with, 'Yes.'\" I was so furious at him that... I swore at him, I said, \"Are you really serious right now? <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201691\">That's a reason to not bother-\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Really fucking serious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">CLIENT: I'm really sorry that I said that, because that's so inappropriate. It's not okay to speak like that to anyone, but I did, because after all that he did and the way he responded to it, and then going off to his parents' and not speaking to me while he's there, and then this?  He doesn't call <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D1\">and I said to him, quite frankly, \"It's not like if we had been dating for a week, I would have expected you to call. This is not a little-no matter how serious or not-serious our relationship was, I would have expected something.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F\">THERAPIST: I know you and him talked earlier in the week, where you said to him, \"I don't want to talk until you're ready to take ownership.\" Do you think he was following-which, again, is not an excuse, because it's still blind to the fact that he should have called anyway to say, \"Regardless of what's <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F1\">going on, I just wanted to say I'm thinking about you.\" Did he say he was following that, or (inaudible at 00:35:44)?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2016E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561754\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20171\">CLIENT: He's mentioned that and he said-he didn't really say, but earlier in the week, he had said, \"I don't know how to find the words.\" I don't know. I said, \"You could have at least tried and called and asked if I wanted to talk about it. You could have, at bare minimum... This is not okay.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20173\">He didn't so much as send a card or-it was nothing, truly nothing. I don't understand that at all. And that sounds very-that's not how I would portray Ivan. Even after what he did, I would not-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20175\">THERAPIST: That's not typical (crosstalk at 00:36:28)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20177\">CLIENT: That's not! I don't get it. In general, I don't get if your spouse's parent a really immediate family member I don't get how you don't... I feel like even if I had done what he did, I still would wonder why he wouldn't call in this type of a situation. It feels very extreme.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20179\">THERAPIST: What does he say about why he didn't call, then, even just to say, \"How are you doing? How's your mom?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017B\">CLIENT: The responses he got to the couple of texts that he did send were terse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017D\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:37:02). Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017F\">CLIENT: That's why he couldn't call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20181\">THERAPIST: He thought you wouldn't want to hear from him, then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20183\">CLIENT: I don't know if that's true. I don't know if that's legitimate. It sounds like a really lame excuse, quite frankly. I'm really worked-up. I don't know what to do. I really feel like he's leaving me no choice but to suggest a separation, because it feels like he's not working to resolve it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20185\">THERAPIST: You don't see him putting in a lot of effort, trying to make this better right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20187\">CLIENT: When I got home, it was clear he had done some laundry. He had tidied the apartment a little bit. He says he's still been sleeping on the couch even over the weekend, because he didn't want to sleep in our bed until things were resolved, even if I wasn't there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20189\">I said, \"Things are not going to be resolved by refusing to speak to me.\" He told me that he acknowledges that what he did and he's trying to think about how it would feel for me and recognize how traumatizing that would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018B\">THERAPIST: He said that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018D\">CLIENT: He did say that. I don't know. He spoke for maybe a minute or two last night, after I said, \"It's been two and a half weeks and you still haven't come up with the words? Seriously?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018F\">But I guess I felt a little good, because the typical me, over the weekend, would have called after him a lot, would have been coaxing him, would have been obsessing about it, and I didn't at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20191\">It feels really bad. It feels really overwhelming. It feels... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20193\">THERAPIST: What he did do, when you say he talked for about a minute about it, and he acknowledged some things that sound like they're important. Did it feel genuine? Did it hit the nerve inside you that felt like, \"Oh, he's starting something that feels like that's what I need more of?\" Or did it feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201931\">like it was Band-Aid-ing, too (inaudible at 00:39:23)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20195\">CLIENT: I guess it felt like a mix. It felt inadequate, especially-I feel like my standards are now raised in what I would expect, because it's been over two weeks. I was half-expecting to come home and find that he had written a 20-page explanation, something really-that he had been really dealing <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201951\">with it and thinking about it and processing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20194-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20194-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561754\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20197\">No matter how genuine and I'm not sure how genuine it was speaking for a minute, really just a few sentences is not... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20199\">THERAPIST: It's just a drop in the bucket...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019B\">CLIENT: It's a drop in the bucket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019D\">THERAPIST: ...compared to what you want to hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F\">(inaudible at 00:40:06) wonders what actually, if you could say, what would help you to hear from him? What would make a difference right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A1\">CLIENT: I'm not sure, but I do feel like a part of it would be an explanation. I still, truly, honest-to-goodness don't understand what it happened. I really don't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A3\">THERAPIST: What if he doesn't get it yet? What if he's sort of going, \"Why would I do this thing? It's a horrible thing, what I did.\" You know what I mean? I'm just asking. Maybe he knows, but what if he doesn't-I guess I might more expect that he doesn't know why he did it, that's the long-term, individual <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A31\">work. What if he doesn't know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A5\">CLIENT: Something that my sister said struck a chord with me, because I kept telling her with some of these things, I didn't know if it was genuinely a mental health problem -for lack of a better description that was at the root of it, or it was a passive-aggressive.  It was a choice. It was a willful <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A51\">thing. Not just with him doing that while I (inaudible at 00:41:16). Those reactions from me would be very different, and my ability to give him another chance, very different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A7\">What she said was, \"I think there comes a point, Ramona, when it doesn't matter why it's happening. It's happening and it's unacceptable.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A9\">And so, I think that's kind of my answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AB\">THERAPIST: If I'm hearing something that might-if there's anything you could hear from him right now that would make a difference, it's maybe him, even if he said, \"Ramona, I don't know why I did this. I know I have to work on figuring that out, but yet, I know that it is absolutely unacceptable and <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201AB1\">I'm so sorry for the way this impacted you.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AD\">Which is different than, \"I'm so bad, I'm so bad, I'm so bad, I'm so evil, I'm so horrible, I'm a monster,\" right?  That's not actually saying, \"This is not acceptable,\" to your face, with eye contact, \"I am sorry and I get it.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AF\">CLIENT: There's never any eye contact.

I have no clue what to do, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BD\">THERAPIST: The more you can go in not looking to change him but not looking even for the answer right now about-in one session, you don't have to come up with whether you're going to separate or not, unless you really want to. You don't have to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BF\">But go in with trying to get some of your armor away and (inaudible at 00:42:56) sharing how hard and how sad and how sad you are, and what you wish you would hear from him, the kinds of things that you feel like you want to hear that would move you. And how that's different than feeling him whipping <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201BF1\">himself, that doesn't move this inside. It doesn't actually feel like you're making contact with each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C1\">Talking about what it is would make a difference for you, instead of whatever's going on with him. I think that has the greatest chance of seeing what could happen inside him, when you're in that place. In some ways, that might be useful for you to know, because then, if you still get any changes when <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201C11\">you lead with your vulnerability if he doesn't soften and go, \"Oh, Ramona,\" and look up and make eye contact with you if none of that starts to happen, you also then know some more about what he's capable of and what he's not capable of. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N201C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561754\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C3\">It's speaking from your experience; it's speaking from your vulnerability.

I'm going to try to take some of that off and just share with you how sad and hurt and upsetting,\" how much <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201C31\">your trust is shattered, how confused you are. All those vulnerable feelings, I think have the greatest chance of eliciting of more contact with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C5\">We'll continue next Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C7\">CLIENT: I need to... ugh.
