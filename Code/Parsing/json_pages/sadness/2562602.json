really remember our conversation from last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">[0:04:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I\u2019m feeling really hot. Sorry. Did we talk about time management or money? I can\u2019t remember. I think it\u2019s was time management because you were asking why I was canceling therapy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yea, that was one of the things we talked about. Are you feeling frazzled today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: No, there\u2019s just a lot of things on my mind. I guess one major thing is Chris\u2019s Dad is in ICU, and we had some hard trouble, and they\u2019re doing tests and stuff, and he has to get a bypass surgery, so I\u2019m kind of upset about that. We found out over the weekend that he\u2019s going to go and visit and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">he\u2019s thinking about how much will it cost because we don\u2019t have insurance and it can be up to $16,000. He doesn\u2019t have that much money, so I\u2019m thinking about helping out. It\u2019s funny because he\u2019s been helping me out. He\u2019s going to like pay for the program that I\u2019m going to do for my book. He\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">to help me pay (laugh) for that and obviously now I don\u2019t think I will as him for that. Yea, like, when he found out his father\u2019s in the ICU at the time we felt a bit guilty. Because we spoke, his father and I spoke like last week. I mean just like congratulating or saying something. That was it but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">we found out he\u2019s sick and I just kind of felt really guilty. I remembered his and my conversation from two years ago when he was \u2018you know we want you guys to get married\u2019 and \u2018 you should understand our position\u2019. And I felt very like. I don\u2019t know. He was putting this expectation on me. I was, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200194\">how do I do this? So, I feel kind of guilty. Because we didn\u2019t know. We just heard that he\u2019s in ICU. We didn\u2019t know for what. So I was thinking, Oh no. Over the last year I\u2019ve been feeling kind of guilty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">[0:07:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019ve mentioned to you that I\u2019ve had some dreams or like Chris\u2019s parents and (inaudible) and they\u2019re friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Talk about these.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Their neighbors and their need and then they are like \u2018oh, my son\u2019s girlfriend\u2019 and then \u2018oh, my son\u2019s girlfriend\u2019. And then I walk in and I\u2019m like majorly embarrassed, horrified and feeling frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">[0:08:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I\u2019m feeling all burdened with that. And that feeling passed, cause then I somehow rationalize what I\u2019m doing with these two guys and how or to the extent of; I feel like I\u2019ve told them the truth, to the extent which I can tell, you know. And I was telling Nelson it was a weird weird weekend, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">like, he was in town with one of his buddies from Ohio and this kind and like, and all he did was party. So like Saturday night, I was comforting him because he was going to call his mom and there is so much there. So his uncle called him to let him know his dad was in ICU. His mom hadn\u2019t called him <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">and he was like \u2018I have to call her\u2019; I know her pretty well and she is not very good at dealing with emotions at all. She\u2019s worse than Chris. At her own mom\u2019s funeral, she kind of stood awkwardly and \u2018thank you for coming\u2019 and then sat down. Whereas her brother was like this really really tough guy, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200253\">an activist. He was like in tears. He was crying. I\u2019m like \u2018what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 I had to talk to her for an hour to convince her to come. She was in a different city. She wasn\u2019t even going to come. I was like \u2018oh, no, you have to come.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562602\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">[0:10:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: So he talked to his mom when I was there. I was supposed to have dinner and drinks with Nelson and his friends. He\u2019s texting me \u2018where are you, where are you, I\u2019m so disappointed\u2019 and this and that. I was like \u2018with friends.\u2019 (inaudible) And they were like \u2018okay, we\u2019re going to go over to this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">place, if you don\u2019t come in fifteen more minutes then you can just, you know, come there when your over\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u2018what!\u2019 Anyway, so it was just weird like, right because he\u2019s thinking of partying because I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s what he does and then Chris is all like sad and he needs my help. We have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">a serious relationship, so that was like the stereotypes I have of them in my head kind of playing out. I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m just babbling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">[0:11:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I felt really horrible leaving him. I felt really that my duty was to stay over and comfort him. I also felt obligated to Nelson and so I did the best I could. I stayed with him for a few hours and comforted him and then I left. Literally I am pulled in two very different directions. Chris\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">parents just make me so nervous and worried about money. So nervous. (laughs) I\u2019m like going along making bad decisions, well not bad decisions, but doing what I want to do and, yea, spending $4,000 on this course that I may not even need. Because I want to do it, and then along comes heart attach or <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">heart trouble (laughs) and the fact that they haven\u2019t been investing wisely and they don\u2019t have that much money and they need help. It\u2019s fine for me help them. I feel like I should think of it as a choice rather than an obligation and that\u2019s something I need to work on but the other side, the undercurrent <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">is like pretty on top, is that me feeling guilty about doing what I\u2019m doing. Like all that, what do you call that, like his mom\u2019s kind of statements and ways of thinking kind of come into play a lot and make me feel nervous about doing what I\u2019m doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">[0:13:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: In the past, but this is ten years ago right. I made a U-turn of what I was going to do, a completely changed course. Just because of the things she said. She said writing is a luxury and this and that, and now they are in the same kind of situation I feel financially. That their business has <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">completely failed and major losses and turning down their business. His dad is like \u2018what?\u2019 Chris was starting a second (inaudible). So his dad just decided to go back to work, luckily he found work at his age. But I want to feel that it is not the same, that it\u2019s different. Their situation won\u2019t affect <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">me, but it is making me nervous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Nervous about . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">[0:14:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: That you would be afraid to end up like them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: No, no, just like right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: That you want to get some money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: No, I guess maybe the former. But not so intense. So I mean every time I visit them I feel completely like I need my own career, a job, money. I\u2019m just going to look even more desperately for a job and I don\u2019t have the time, I have a deadline for finishing another whole job in a month. So I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">don\u2019t have time. I can\u2019t waste time any more. What am I saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562602\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">[0:15:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: No, your question was why am I nervous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yea, you said \u2018it makes me nervous about money\u2019 so I\u2019m just wondering what the \u2018it\u2019 is. Whether it was seeing them, whether it was the immediate demand of feeling like you should give them money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yea, so every time I help someone with money or I see someone not doing fine financially well, I want to make sure I have money, or I have a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">[0:15:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: So it makes you feel anxious about your own security.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yea. I woke up last night, I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was thinking \u2018what am I doing about . . . \u2018 So there are a few pressing things. I won\u2019t have an income any more in the summer and then you know housing for next year. So I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll just move in with my mom. (inaudible) and then I can\u2019t sleep <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">wherever, and work forever. I feel I can work from different locations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I feel like my situation is getting precarious but then is it precarious or is it me just feeling like it is precarious, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: And here I haven\u2019t been hearing back. I\u2019ve applied to a lot of places. I guess I have to look more aggressively or more strategically or both. I mean, I don\u2019t know. Maybe the situation is a good reality check. But it kind of, it feels like it can be a bit more than that. It could be, not just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">a reality check but like a shock or something that makes me give up my own kind of plans and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: What do you think about what his dad said to me?

And from him, and how should it affect me in the sense that . .(laughs) . I mean like it is a bit complicated in my case because I really didn\u2019t have a father who cared, so why I like that his father seems to care and you know can help me out and has (inaudible) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">and I don\u2019t know exactly what I would like. I guess when I go to India he would give me a SIM (?) card or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">[0:19:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: What is that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: For the phone. So you can use your phone. Yea, they both will let me stay at their place. But like it is their expectation that they have a standing in the community and they are all kind of conservative and they\u2019ve told people that I am going to marry their son and I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">so far away from that. I try to talk to his mom. Like \u2018you don\u2019t understand Emmet and I don\u2019t have that kind of relationship, you know what I\u2019m talking about, right?\u2019 And she\u2019s like \u2018shut up and just get married. That will solve everything.\u2019 And every time I go I have this intense moment where I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B2\">just want to jump off the balcony because they get to me so much. It happens every time. Cause he doesn\u2019t even understand. \u2018Your mom is such a bully.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t help that I try and empathize. While I am sitting here, miles away, I sympathize, you know. I see her like with Chris actually there, it just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B3\">really gets to me the fact that I can\u2019t really cook in her kitchen. Yea, that\u2019s the conversation I\u2019m trying to tell her that \u2018you know your son and I blah blah blah\u2019 and she\u2019s just like \u2018oh just married.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">[0:21:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: And me taking things too personally when I shouldn\u2019t, with them praising their son to the sky.

I guess that\u2019s what I heard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Well it\u2019s nice to know that they like me and they care about me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">[0:23:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not only that they want their son to get married, they think of you as a good prospective wife.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Yea. I mean, thank you I\u2019m flattered. You know what I\u2019m saying? But, I feel like my freedom is really a gigantic price to pay for that compliment. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t think in terms of transaction. I\u2019m not saying \u2018I\u2019d rather you guys hate me.\u2019 Of course not. But, you know. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: But it sounds like from that way of thinking that you think they want to purchase you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: No. I feel like we could open up another frontier of dialog. I just have to be strong. Maybe Chris is not strong but I could be strong. He cannot talk to his mom and clearly I tried and it\u2019s like talking to a wall. But still I can try because things are changing. People don\u2019t necessarily get <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">married. It doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t care as much or love each other less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">[0:25:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: I feel like at the least she should understand that she went through the exact same thing that I am going through as a woman. Trying to build a life of your own. Trying to be independent. Trying not to look to your male counterpart for money and fulfillment. Which is what she did and she regrets <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">it every single day of her life. So she should recognize that that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do too. Because I really was at that point where I would look a lot to Chris for fulfillment. As usual for me with everything, I am not the other side now. I don\u2019t look to him for anything. Well, I do, but I\u2019m trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A12\">not to. So I\u2019m trying to build a life and she should at least see that and understand that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I was thinking. I was thinking that it seems like you were looking towards these people for not only Chris\u2019s parents for, not only encouragement for the choices you are making. It kind of reminds me what we were talking about, about looking for a parent. Whereas they have their <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">own agenda. They have their own needs.

That would be nice, I\u2019m not saying it wouldn\u2019t be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: It wouldn\u2019t be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not saying it wouldn\u2019t be but there is a way in which you are looking for this nurturing from people who have their own agendas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">[0:27:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yea, I don\u2019t like that. I don\u2019t think they should have their own agenda. I mean, do I have my own agenda?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Sure you do. You\u2019re not saying \u2018I\u2019m going to marry Chris.

You\u2019ve helped them out financially.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: No, really? When someone\u2019s life is at stake, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to say? (Laughs.) (Pause.) I don\u2019t know about that. What is the lesson that I\u2019m supposed to learn here? That people have their own agendas?

I don\u2019t get what\u2019s happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re saying \u2018they\u2019re not?\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: No, I didn\u2019t hear you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Well, I was saying that you get upset. Just what I was saying before. That they\u2019re not advancing your agenda.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yea, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: And part of it is because you feel guilty. You want their encouragement and support and yet you feel guilty that you are not sort of complying with other people\u2019s needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yea, I feel that when they were encouraging me last week, I felt like this is really cheating, in the sense that I don\u2019t deserve this. And if you knew what I was doing, you know, you would not say any of these words. You would take them back. You would hurl curses at me or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">[0:29:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: I really thought, you know, think situations like these make things seem really queer in some ways. I don\u2019t know. Like, almost needing (inaudible). (Laughs.) It\u2019s funny, like that thing is the thing that would make me feel attractive towards him in the first place but now, that night, it felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E11\">like a burden. And like, I hurt my finger really badly that night as well. It was so painful. Then the next morning I had to keep it elevated so I was walking around like this. Nelson was laughing so hard, I even peed a little bit. He was like spitting he was laughing so hard. I felt kind of like \u2018 <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E12\">yea I\u2019ve got you now, you\u2019re a horrible person, you don\u2019t care about me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: What do you think that was about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: \u2018I\u2019ve got you now, you\u2019re a horrible person, you don\u2019t care about me.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: No it\u2019s just me trying to break up with him like because this situation is supposed to indicate that I can connect with Chris on various registers, on many more registers than I would. But Nelson so like \u2018okay it\u2019s time\u2019. I have to think about what I need. I can live with Chris but that\u2019s you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E91\">know, say financially it makes much more sense for him and me. So, I should do that. (inaudible) We talked and we talked and I feel like he\u2019s manipulating me, he\u2019s just really good at presenting counter arguments and stuff. I don\u2019t know. He acts silly a lot but when he actually speaks, it\u2019s like okay <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E92\">there is a head there. It does think. (Laughs) He\u2019s talking there\u2019s a general sense in which people care about each other and then there\u2019s a specific instances then and just because in certain specific instances things don\u2019t work out, it will seem the other person cares. It doesn\u2019t mean that generally <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E93\">they don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t know, I kept thinking about that so I forgot that I was mad at him and wanted to break up. This happens that quite a log.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562602\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: I was going to ask you, I don\u2019t know if this is tangent or not, but when you started you were talking about \u2018well, what were we talking about last week. I don\u2019t remember.\u2019 And then you had this whole thing happen that took you a few minutes to talk about in terms of Chris\u2019s dad being in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB1\">ICU. What makes you not start with that. You know what I mean? This is something that is really important and on your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: I need an ice-breaker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">[0:33:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Can you say something about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: I just feel it\u2019s like a blank slate. You need kind of a warm up exercise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you lose our connection, a feeling of our connection in between sessions and so it doesn\u2019t feel like \u2018oh my gosh let me tell you what happened\u2019 like you can\u2019t do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t do that with anyone. I really don\u2019t think I can do that Nelson, Chris, even my mom. Even with my mom. Some people are better or really good at warming me up so I don\u2019t even notice, but yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: The way you put it \u2018warming you up\u2019, that\u2019s interesting. That\u2019s an interesting way to phrase it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yea, an incorrect usage but yea I feel disconnected if I have to start the conversation then yea. If I were teaching a class then I would be more systematic about it because the onus would be on me and I would do a good job. Here I feel like I don\u2019t know what the structure is. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB1\">say that you\u2019re supposed to know by now but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of knowing though, it\u2019s a matter of how you feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">[0:33:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: Like my presence, or my looking toward you is an implicit invitation to tell me anything really, but certainly something that\u2019s on mind that\u2019s bothering you, for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: I guess I feel shy about talking about myself even though I do it twice every week, it still feels like, yea . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: Because it seems like in sort of asking about what we talked about the last session, you are looking for some thread to pick up on, or some connection in terms of content in a sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: Or continuity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: It seems to ebb and flow a bit, because I know there was certainly a period where you would start and say \u2018I thought a lot about what we said last time\u2019. And it felt like you felt some more sense of continuity there, a connection. And it feels like that\u2019s not been as true the last few months, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B1\">where it seems like you\u2019re searching a little bit where to start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yea, I guess so, I don\u2019t know. Maybe I have been frazzled. I wonder if it\u2019s got something to do with where I wake up or which place I\u2019m in. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s pretty bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: So in that sense, sort of, I don\u2019t know, questioning your attachments. Like dating Nelson, moving out of Chris\u2019s house, like that has made you more insecure about all of your connections. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20110-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20110-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562602\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">[0:37:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: All of my connections?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: Meaning that that process that you\u2019re going through that maybe it\u2019s impacted all of your connections, like in here too. I don\u2019t know. My first thought was whether my being away for a period of time was making you feel that way. You know, my anticipated being away for five or six weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: I anticipate it, I do, but not this. There\u2019s a lot of things that I just don\u2019t think about. That I should think about that I just don\u2019t. I guess I\u2019ll be nervous the week before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Well maybe we should anticipate it together now so it feels less scary or whatever when it comes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: There\u2019s so many things we\u2019re scared about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Well, that only speaks just getting to work around them versus trying to just not think about them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">[0:39:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: Yea, I guess like moving out of Chris\u2019s apartment, is it like having a negative effect?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: Clearly there\u2019s positive. I don\u2019t think about it as negative as much as its made you anxious to question your attachment to him. Question the longevity of your relationship. It\u2019s made you anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: Yea. What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know, but the reason I sort of avoided the negative, your comment about the negative, because you very quickly want to put value judgment and make a decision based on \u2018oh that was bad so maybe I should undo what I did to make it good again\u2019 so that\u2019s why negative. I guess you could <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201291\">say anxiety is negative. But I\u2019m not sure I would want to make that leap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s made you anxious. It\u2019s also made you feel good in many ways. Being attached to him and feeling like to you needed to hold on to that in the way that you were also made you feel anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">CLIENT: (inaudible) to be anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">[0:40:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know about that. There are a lot of things that cause you anxiety and we\u2019re trying to talk about them together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I feel like, obviously when I moved out it felt that I was riding a high wave of some sort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I feel like my own place would be the answer to everything, but . . . That\u2019s the point. How do I get it? I could get a job first and that\u2019s like, I\u2019m not very successful in finding one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not just the fact that I\u2019m not with him and obviously that\u2019s why that\u2019s some kind of stability. And having three or four places does make me a little crazy. I\u2019m not able to do a lot of things that I used to be able to do when I was running from one place to the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Like what? What aren\u2019t you able to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\">CLIENT: Just like, I\u2019ve been far less productive. I\u2019ve had to prioritize and I only get done two or three things. I don\u2019t get my homework done in time at all. I used to be a part of this woman\u2019s group and I haven\u2019t gone to their meetings. I haven\u2019t been as political. I haven\u2019t worked on the magazine. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201411\">Yea, like a lot of things that are not happening. Like I\u2019m in triage war or something. I just kind of think of writing and do it when I get time. And then I scramble together my homework and go to school and that just either visit Chris or Nelson or my mom. (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">[0:43:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20145\">CLIENT: I need to be a bit more strategic I guess. (Pause) I mean, I feel like I wouldn\u2019t be that way if I was just at my place and just visited my mom and that\u2019s it. I feel like these two guys, I think of them as obligations for different reasons. Are we out of time?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20144-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20144-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562602\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">THERAPIST: Yea.
