[Pause] Hi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Hi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I got home after leaving here yesterday and went to sleep. I was so exhausted. I didn\u2019t quickly go to bed but I went to sleep. Jeremy was doing all these things with coaxial cables and the routers and modems in the living room. He was sitting in the middle of the floor with thick wires going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">across the room from his laptop. I grabbed the pillow and lied down next to him and went to sleep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">Do you think it was [inaudible at 00:02:38]? Might, but I\u2019m not sure why. I think I dreamed of a [inaudible at 00:03:07]. Do you think it\u2019s rough to say I love you and to not hear it back even though I feel the least attached to that, that I\u2019ve ever been? I got used to an attachment there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">I dreamed that I didn\u2019t leave when you asked me to. Your next patient had to get me to leave. There were two patients. I don\u2019t know if I stayed in that waiting room and came back in after the first one left and then the second one had to ask me to leave too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So do you mean you stayed through the next one session and then the one after that had to ask you to leave?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Well two patients asked me to leave and it\u2019s not from the dream whether it\u2019s because I stayed for the first one\u2019s session or if it just happened again or every day. It was this woman who gave this talk last Thursday it was [inaudible at 00:05:25] the first time. She was very [inaudible at 00:05:33].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: You had a talk at work or a fancy [inaudible at 00:05:34]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yes, yes at work. [Pause] I also seemed too sort of heavy as the session went on. [inaudible at 00:06:37]. [Pause] Do you have a sense of what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: When you\u2019re very (ph) heavy? I assume you mean like, what\u2019s the name, lighthearted or upbeat but rather serious or dour I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yes because that plus when you have some stuff to say but you don\u2019t quite like it, which I think [inaudible at 00:08:51]. You don\u2019t say it but you\u2019re really thinking about things you don\u2019t have anything to say yet. There\u2019s a lot of that combined with this sort of down [inaudible at 00:09:14]. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">I think it\u2019s bothering me because if we had had more time I find, sometimes I feel if I had talked less I would have, some of that would\u2019ve kind of helped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s one of the things I was thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Or they would have formed in a way that made me comfortable talking about them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">[inaudible at [00:11:41] I had long talks with Brenda (ph) before the really 2012 schedule change question before this one. [Pause] I mean the first time was I think I called her and we talked on the phone for a long time. On Sunday we just had one of our normal woods walks and the topic was not events <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">or you but somehow the result of that day. Talking about most of my day being just constellation, contemplative, coping things, little bitty sightseeing right? We talked a lot about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">But there\u2019s something about it being fueled by her feeling confident, more confident in something that\u2019s true about both times. I\u2019m really ripe for an anchor or something. Jeremy and I talked about this recently. I said Jeremy I feel adrift. He said I do too. I asked him what his adrift felt like. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">said I think my adrift feels like I have no anchor. And it was really interesting, Jeremy said oh I am so unanchored; I have no sails. Then we got into ourselves over it because I did not get that at first. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562286\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">But I think I feel like I have a lot of sails. I have many things, many people, many drives to sort of set me in a direction. But none of them but I have no way to stop or no way to rest. It\u2019s more the resting, you know refuge. Everything seems really [inaudible at 00:15:31] minty (ph). Also it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">hard to know which direction is a good one when you can\u2019t stop or when it\u2019s up to the wind and not in my control which I feel like I have the anchor of all anchors in my family. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">I think for Jeremy, everywhere he looks he wants just to stop. If things are too hard or things are uncertain or such, or reflective I think that\u2019s what he means by anchor, things holding him back. He doesn\u2019t know which direction is a good one or he can\u2019t find one because he has no sails. He can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">catch the wind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: When (ph) we\u2019re back on the ocean, because we were yesterday too with the dream on the boat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yes. There was a lot of swaying and everything was screwed down, all the furniture was screwed down. There was nothing else that made it feel like a boat but that\u2019s pretty boaty. Didn\u2019t we leave the ocean for a little while?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yes I mean it\u2019s been a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Where did we go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well your question relates to what I was going to say which is I think I apparently am leaving you adrift. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Why is your job to anchor me? Pray (ph) yes, but I\u2019m not sure why that\u2019s a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Well -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yes, fine. You are leaving me adrift, Ivan (ph) is leaving me adrift, my work is leaving me adrift, my meditation practice is leaving me adrift, I am leaving myself adrift.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Sticking with me for a minute because it\u2019s clear to me I didn\u2019t have much to say towards the end yesterday I guess. I didn\u2019t reciprocate when you told me that you, I mean I also didn\u2019t really answer about what I think or how I feel about you. I guess it seems to me also I think at the end <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">of the hour that\u2019s another way of leading you adrift. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yes, I don\u2019t want to hear it\u2019s time to stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I mean so far all I\u2019m saying is I think these are the ways I\u2019m leaving you adrift.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:21:40]. And yet you\u2019re not leaving me altogether. So that\u2019s the worst kind. I can\u2019t move to another part of the ocean or another ocean. I can\u2019t forget about you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: I guess in so many ways I\u2019m not as you were the people at work, like give you a big hug, hold you when you cry, being supportive in quite that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m not doing that for you. I think I felt that more than the other line (ph). Like you\u2019re leaving me adrift by not <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: But I use that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Jeremy did a lot of that last night. [Pause] So yes, you\u2019re not letting me hear my calling, hear [when I\u2019m not] (ph) when I stand where you are and keeping my feelings right around. I hate the way of calling but I used it yesterday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562286\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: It makes me think of the bus driving except this is sort of I think in a way if it weren\u2019t confound to [inaudible at 00:25:16] in that you\u2019re not driving the bus, I\u2019m not driving the bus, there is no bus, there\u2019s no road, there\u2019s no pant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: So what about it making it bus driving?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Because I think maybe in a more fundamental way there\u2019s a sense of things being wide open and out of control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yes, like when I\u2019m not driving the bus, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Or when I or someone else is leaving you drifting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yes I guess somehow it doesn\u2019t matter to you. You don\u2019t have to anchor, it\u2019s not your job to anchor me and it\u2019s not your I think I don\u2019t expect it. I guess those things that don\u2019t matter when I\u2019m feeling really adrift. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Your message is that you, it makes you feel needy and dependent, which sucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: That I\u2019m lost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yes. And it matters so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Well it\u2019s also very scary. What was that anchor, what was my life, what would my boat look like if it were anchored inside of you because that would be weird; that would be strange unless a lot of things changed. The way it is now, it\u2019s a really bad anchor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">Sometimes you\u2019re in the ocean, sometimes you\u2019re in the wind and sometimes you\u2019re on a sandbar on the side of me, a little bit ahead of something. But yes, none of those is an anchor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">It\u2019s not clear why it\u2019s so scary with that feeling adrift. Nobody died from being adrift, or maybe they did. But it\u2019s very bad; it\u2019s a very unpalatable feeling, really bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">It\u2019s not clear also why what would an anchor look like through this ocean? Let\u2019s say it\u2019s growing and it comes for me. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a way to anchor myself. It\u2019s a very bottomless <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Actually I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I think there are moments you have felt anchored here and I think now for some reason that\u2019s your experience with this and with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Can you think of when I felt anchored?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Sure, at the beginning of the hour yesterday and the way that we talked about what was going on with wanting to change the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yes, once that was more or less clear what you were trying, what you were doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: We should stop right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the difference between having some joint experience to talk about that we were both here for and the rest of the time, which feels like I was alone.
