Wow! You look great! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Thanks! And I\u2019ll be coming back part-time pretty soon, so, after, so I\u2019ll probably, after about five weeks, I\u2019ll be here, you know, a couple of days a week. So I should be able to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Okay, yeah, we can figure out a...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, a schedule and so forth. But I should, you know, I\u2019m certain the people that I\u2019m seeing now, I should be able to accommodate, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Okay, great!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: So, especially the daytime. Yeah, so probably... you know, the third week in June to probably, you know, toward the end of July, so about five weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Okay, yeah, that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s fun! That\u2019s great! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">So, I feel like the last time I saw you, I was like a hot mess. I was like, really, really bad. But, that was two weeks ago, so I\u2019m a lot better today. I went away last week with my girlfriends, and that was awesome. That was like, exactly what I needed, I think, you know? It was... I mean, then after <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">I saw you, the next day I was feeling better. I think I just was having a really rough day that day. That weekend, I saw my friend, Carla and I went over with my son for a play date. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">She was really honest with me. She was really great. She was like, you know, she was like, \u201cListen...,\u201d(because we\u2019re mutual friends with a couple of people that aren\u2019t talking to me). She was like, \u201cHere is the deal.\u201d She was like, \u201cI just want you to know what\u2019s happening, because I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">She was like, \u201cRich is making you, is painting you out to be a really, really horrible person to everyone.\u201d She was like, you know, \u201cHe is giving us so many details. Like, so many, so many details.\u201d She was like, \u201cI don\u2019t even want to know them.\u201d She was like, \u201cIt\u2019s none of my business. Like, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200372\">care to know them.\u201d She was like, you know, \u201cI\u2019m not going to like...\u201d She was like, \u201cThe way I see it is, you know, he\u2019s making it, making you sound a certain way, and I\u2019m just not going to believe all of it, because, you know, it\u2019s coming from his mouth and he\u2019s very upset.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">So she was like, \u201cThe thing is, these other people, these other friends, are very quick to judge,\u201d and she was like, \u201cYou know, they\u2019ve pretty much, you know, you\u2019re right, they don\u2019t want to be your friend,\u201d and she was like, \u201cThere is nothing you can say or do to change their mind at this point.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">She was like, \u201cI just thought you should know that, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for you not to know that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">So... which I appreciated her saying that, you know. She... You know, I tried to explain to her... And not that I was explaining, but what she said was, she was like, \u201cThe thing is, I think what happens is,\u201d she said, \u201cYou know, Rich is so open about so many details, and you\u2019re not at all. So people, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">I think, assume that everything he\u2019s saying is true about you.\u201d So... you know, and something like, he was telling them how I went out on Valentine\u2019s Day, because I got a babysitter that night to go out with my girlfriends from work, who wanted to take me out for Valentine\u2019s Day, to dinner. So, she <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B2\">was like, you know, we heard about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562656\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">I was like, \u201cWhy is that a bad thing? Why am I not allowed to go (chuckles) out on Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d And she was like, \u201cExactly! I don\u2019t think there is anything...\u201d You know, I put my son to bed. It wasn\u2019t like I... didn\u2019t even go home. It\u2019s like, I picked him up from preschool, I gave him dinner, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">put him to bed, and the sitter came after he was asleep. So like, that... and I was gone for like, three hours or something. So, and I said that to Carla. She was like, \u201cNo, I know. I don\u2019t think... you know, there is anything wrong with that. He just is kind of making it look like you... don\u2019t even <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">like, you know, even when Brady\u2019s there, you\u2019re just kind of like, not there with him or something and that he said he could have watched him, that he would have just taken him, if you were going to be going out or something.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">Which I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s insane, because I put him to bed and I was there when he woke up, so (chuckles) like...\u201d So she was like, \u201cYou know, we hear, it\u2019s like, all that stuff like, you know...\u201d He... you know, and then another week that I had Brady, I got a sitter to go out to dinner for my friend\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">birthday. Again, whenever I get a sitter, I put Brady to bed. It\u2019s not like I... I know eventually, one day I\u2019ll have to go out a little earlier than like, 7:30 or 8:00, but for now, I just do it, so I can have as much time with him. You know, I think one of my friends put a picture on Facebook that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">we were out to dinner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">The next morning, he called me right, first thing in the morning. He was like, \u201cDid you go out last night?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d He was like, \u201cWell, you need to tell me when you go out and when you have a sitter.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhy?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause I need to know if something goes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">wrong.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, the sitter has your contact information, you know. But, they would contact me like, you know...\u201d And he was like, \u201cI just need you to tell me every time you get a sitter, when you have him.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">I mean, I don\u2019t have to do that! That\u2019s like, crazy, you know, to have to... every single time. And then, I said to my friend, Carla, I said, \u201cWell... and then if I go out twice in one week, what\u2019s he going to say? Like, you know, I feel like it will...\u201d You know, not that I do. You know, if anything, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">I just go out once during the week, when I have Brady, or if, not at all, but... I said, you know, \u201cThen it just like... feeds this whole like, notion that I\u2019m like, out partying and being like, reckless or something,\u201d you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">So, anyway, she, I just kind of explained to her, I said, \u201cYou know, my personality is, I don\u2019t talk about my feelings in general. I\u2019m not this like, super open book in general. So this whole process has been, you know, I obviously talk about it with like, you and like, my very close friends who have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">known me for dec , you know, over a decade or longer, but I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not going to like, just go up to all of my friends and just be like, \u2018He, this is why I was unhappy with him. You know, did you know he does this and doesn\u2019t do this.\u2019 Like, I\u2019m like, that\u2019s not how I am. I don\u2019t want to do that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">I don\u2019t want to like... I just don\u2019t see the point of it, you know.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562656\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">So, she was like, \u201cWell, he\u2019s doing the opposite, (chuckles) so...\u201d But she was like, No, she was like, \u201cI completely understand.\u201d Then I just said to her, I said, \u201cYou know quite honestly, (because we do these like, ladies\u2019 dinners every other week and those girls are there), and I said, I don\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">want to keep doing those if they don\u2019t, if they\u2019re like talking about me and they don\u2019t like me.\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t really see the point of being around people that don\u2019t want to, you know, be around me. So, I just, those kind of negative vibes I don\u2019t really need to be like, around.\u201d She was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200472\">\u201cWell, you know, just come for one more and then maybe let them know you\u2019re happy to answer any questions or...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">And I said, \u201cWell, they know they are always able to contact me,\u201d but I was like, \u201cI really don\u2019t want to sit at a dinner table and stand trial for why I ended my marriage.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI didn\u2019t marry them. I married Rich. I didn\u2019t leave them. I left Rich, so it\u2019s really kind of between me and him, but... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">You know, my other friends don\u2019t seem to need an explanation, so I don\u2019t really see why I have to give it to them.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">So, when I left, you know, this was right before I left for California, I... was really pissed! I was really like, upset with him for continuing to like, just, you know, talk... I\u2019ve asked him multiple times not to, and he continues to. Then, so that Sunday, when he picked up Brady, I said to him, \u201cYou <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">know, I talked to Carla, and you know, she\u2019s telling me you\u2019re telling everyone everything. You know, she doesn\u2019t even want, you know, they don\u2019t even want to hear all the details. Some people don\u2019t really want to know everything, you know? He was like, \u201cWell...\u201d (the same answer), \u201cI\u2019m just being honest <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">and open, you know. That\u2019s all I\u2019m doing.\u201d And I said, \u201cI guess,\u201d but I said, \u201cYou know, people don\u2019t want to be that involved. I mean, they can be supportive, but they don\u2019t want to know like, everything, you know?\u201d And I said, \u201cAnd now for nothing like, you know, I\u2019m already, you know, you\u2019re, people <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B3\">don\u2019t want to be my friend because of it.\u201d And he was just like... \u201cOh, well.\u201d (chuckles) you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">I said, you know, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d I said, \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to be my friend, whatever; then I don\u2019t need them as friends,\u201d but I said, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t need... peop , you know, I don\u2019t need this getting around so much, so that every single person on, you know, involved or even who knows us knows <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">this.\u201d I definitely don\u2019t want it to get into work anymore, you know like... I was just like, \u201cCan\u2019t, you know, do you understand that like, I need, you know, I have a rep\u2014I\u2019ve been at work for 12 years like, I have a reputation there like, that\u2019s how I pay my bills, how I feed Brady, you know like...\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">He just was like, \u201cWell, you know...\u201d He got really upset and he said, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the one that married me, and then you\u2019re the one that had a baby with me, cheated on me, and then left me. So you need to own it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562656\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">I said, \u201cI am owning it! I told you what I did and I apologized.\u201d And I think he meant like, I should suffer consequences. That\u2019s probably the better words (chuckles) he could have used than like, I should own it. So... you know, I was upset. He could see I was upset, and then I was trying not to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">upset in front of Brady, because he was right there. So... he was like, \u201cI\u2019m not doing a smear campaign against you.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cBut it seems...\u201d I was like, \u201cIt really seems like you are, though.\u201d So... and that\u2019s kind of, and then he left, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">Then I was really bummed that day. I just felt like, really crappy that day. It was like Sunday, it was right before I was getting on my flight to see my, to go down. I just was pissed at him and I was just... I don\u2019t know. I just felt like really shitty and alone, I guess. And then, I mean, fortunately, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">I called my friend down in California. She was just... You know, my friends have been great. They were just like, \u201cCall whenever.\u201d So I called her and talked to her for a while, and she was like, \u201cGet on the plane, you\u2019re going to see me in a few hours.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">So I went down there and it was... like, you know, it was perfect. It was my friends who\u2019ve known me and him since like we started dating, so, you know, my one friend was kind of like, \u201cYeah, I was kind of waiting for this to happen at some point.\u201d (chuckles) Which I thought was funny. And they were <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">just like, great. They were just like, the most supportive people and totally understanding. We just talked a lot about it. I mean, it was just like having therapy for like, seven days with your close (chuckles) friends and... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">So, it was great, it was wonderful, it was a really good trip. I was worried that, when I came back, I was going to be like, depressed again, just because I wouldn\u2019t be around them, it was going to be cold here. But I almost feel like, it gave me like this Vitamin D and like, positive energy boost that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">I\u2019m still like, riding right now. So, I got back Sunday, I picked up Brady, and you know, so far, I\u2019ve had really good days, just kind of, I\u2019m kind of like... over the people who don\u2019t want to be my friend. I\u2019m just kind of like, \u201cWell, now I know.\u201d You know, my friends have all been like, \u201cYou know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200552\">what? Screw them like, you know, maybe one day they\u2019ll come and apologize for being this way,\u201d you know, but... for now, I\u2019m not going to, you know, sob about it or try to get their friendship back. I just... I don\u2019t want to deal with that, you know. I just want to deal with the friends that are good, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200553\">you know. Because I have so many, that I feel like I... I\u2019m always touching base with them and talking with them now, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">So yeah, so I\u2019m feeling good about that. I feel good now that I\u2019m back, that I am like, okay, I\u2019m going to, now I\u2019m home for a while, so I\u2019m going to like, focus on getting my apartment together and you know, finishing getting it like, furnished, because I really want to do that by the end of this month, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">because I don\u2019t need that too many things. (pause) So that\u2019s been good so far, this week. So I\u2019m feeling a lot better.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562656\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">I had a very odd conversation with my parents on Sunday, actually when I got back. I was talking to my parents like on, you know, FaceTime, so they could see Brady. My mom has like, been losing her memory for many years. I mean, she\u2019s still pretty much there, but like... Okay, she\u2019ll forget like, things <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200591\">that we just did something or just talked about something, she\u2019ll forget that. So we\u2019re on FaceTime and, you know, my dad is kind of just like, \u201cHow are you doing,\u201d you know. I hadn\u2019t talked to them in weeks. My parents are just... it\u2019s like, I think other people who have like, good relationships and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200592\">normal parents, their parents would be like calling them consistently and checking on them. Like, I hadn\u2019t heard from my parents in like, several weeks like, two and half weeks or something. And whatever; that\u2019s just kind of how we\u2019ve always been. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">They\u2019re just not super... I don\u2019t know what it is. I think they like, worry about us, but they don\u2019t like, make an effort to like, check in and they don\u2019t really make an effort to listen very well, so... I don\u2019t know. So, anyway, so I called them and my dad was just like, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d And I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B1\">like, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m okay. Some tough days, but overall, good.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m really worried about money like...\u201d The finances are kind of like, actually the most stressful, probably the only big stress thing I have right now, besides... I would say that\u2019s like the only thing that\u2019s like, really weighing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B2\">on me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Has he started to pay any sort of child support?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">CLIENT: No, so we\u2019re meeting with our mediator on Monday, and so she... So when we talk to her, she said... If we agree on everything, which... Did I tell you? I don\u2019t know if I told you this yet, that we talked to her? That, if we agree... Because we\u2019re both wanting to do the joint file, the one where <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">it\u2019s like, we do it together, so we don\u2019t have to be in the court system forever. So, and he really wants to do that one, too, because he doesn\u2019t want to pay for a lawyer, like, lawyers and everything. So she said if we agree on everything, that we could pretty much finalize everything in two sessions <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F2\">with her, which are like, each two hours. So she was like, \u201cWe could it in like four hours, maybe six, if you... like, we need to talk something out.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">So she was like, \u201cYou could conceivably be divorced like, at the courthouse, in April.\u201d And, because Rich was like, \u201cI want to get this over with as soon as possible.\u201d He was like, \u201cI just want to, I want, what\u2019s the fastest we can do it?\u201d And she was like, \u201cYou could do it as early as April, if everything, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">if you guys agree to everything.\u201d So we said, \u201cOkay.\u201d And then, so what we\u2019re do , no, he hasn\u2019t given me any money at all, so he gave me half of the tax return, which was like $2500, that\u2019s all he\u2019s given me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">(pause) So, she gave us each these full financial disclosure documents we have to fill out. So he gets one that\u2019s for people who make, you know, six figures, and I get the one for people who don\u2019t make (chuckles) six figures, because I don\u2019t make that much money. And so she\u2019s, that, she\u2019s like, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">know, she explained in that, in the phone call that we had with her, she was like, \u201cYou\u2019re going to put down everything you make, everything you spend, everything you owe like, debt-wise,\u201d she was like, \u201cEverything financial about you goes in these documents: your retirement, your health insurance...\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200632\">Because I\u2019m paying the health insurance. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562656\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">So I had to ask him the other day for like, money for the health insurance. And he\u2019s very particular like, when I said to him, I said, \u201cHey, you know, I\u2019ve been paying the family health insurance this month, February. Can you give me half of it? It\u2019s $172.\u201d He was like, \u201cI need you to send me a pay <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200651\">stub, so I know that\u2019s the exact amount.\u201d And I\u2019m like... (whispers) \u201cFine.\u201d So he\u2019s been very like, particular about finances. So I\u2019m won , I wonder what he\u2019ll be like, when things are decided, because what she said is... they take that and then... She explained, she said, you know, \u201cWhat we do with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200652\">the money is, we divide it up so you both are living comfortably and able to support yourselves and Brady.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">So she was like, \u201cNot one of you, one of you will not be living poorly while the other one lives much better.\u201d So, she was like, \u201cThis is where, there is a formula to it, where you\u2019ll, we\u2019ll figure out alimony and child support, because, you know, we want to make sure both of you can afford to put Brady <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200671\">into soccer game, you know, soccer team, you know like, extra-curricular.\u201d So she\u2019s like, \u201cWe\u2019ll work all of that out.\u201d So I\u2019m supposed to send in the statement this week. But, no, he hasn\u2019t given me any money at all. So, I\u2019m like barely living on what I can live on. I know of, you know, someone I spoke <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200672\">to recently. She was divorced a year ago, and she was like, \u201cYou\u2019ll get it retroactively,\u201d but she\u2019s like, \u201cHe really should be giving you something now,\u201d but, he\u2019s not. Because I, he wouldn\u2019t even know what to give me, I don\u2019t think. I feel like he just needs like, a lawyer to tell him how much he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200673\">got to give me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">Because the other day I asked him, I said, \u201cOh, there is a...\u201d I want to pay off the Nordstrom credit card, which is what we use for Christmas presents. He was like, \u201cI already gave you money for credit card bills.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYou mean $2500?\u201d Because we have like, $14,000 on one credit card that we <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200691\">need to pay. And I was like... and this is a completely different card. And he\u2019s like, \u201cOh. Well...\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cIt\u2019s $300, you just need to give me $150 and that\u2019s it.\u201d Like, it\u2019s not even... like that much money, but it\u2019s... trying to get it, have him give me money has not been super easy. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200692\">like, every morning, practically, he sends me a text like, \u201cTransfer money for such and such like, transfer...,\u201d because our joint is still open and things are still hitting it. And it\u2019s just like, \u201cTransfer this, transfer this, transfer this.\u201d I\u2019m like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">THERAPIST: You shouldn\u2019t be paying half for things, because you\u2019re not getting any money from him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">CLIENT: Well, I\u2019m paying for like, my gym. Like, he\u2019ll be like, your gym got like, because I have a gym membership. So he\u2019s like, \u201cYour gym just got pulled from our joint, so you need to add for that, or your car insurance...\u201d My car insurance, I have to put in for that. So right now, we\u2019re paying like... <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D1\">no, it\u2019s a mess. I mean... I don\u2019t know. I mean, I hope he, they give me money (chuckles) retroactively. And like, I had a huge expense just moving like, buying everything and moving. It\u2019s just been... really expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562656\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">(pause) So, I don\u2019t know how he\u2019ll be with that. I mean, I think he\u2019s kind of has to know. I mean, I think once he sees how much I make and then how much... I\u2019m spending, that I actually can\u2019t live on what I\u2019m making, you know? I mean, I\u2019m at the brink of like, do I... I\u2019m considering giving my dog <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F1\">to a friend, because I don\u2019t think I can afford him. So... I don\u2019t know. I asked Rich if he would consider taking the dog when he took Brady, because that would help a little bit, and we could split the cost of things, and he said no. So... And my... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">THERAPIST: It will be very soon, that he\u2019ll start giving you money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">CLIENT: Right. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of holding off right now. I\u2019m hoping like, I could start getting money in the next like, few weeks or something. And just to even like... I\u2019m almost like, working on this like, \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d kind of thing, where I\u2019m actually just like, not even thinking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200731\">the money, because I think when I do think about it, I start to like, really get stressed out about it. (pause) Because I worry, I can\u2019t like, pay for things, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re worried you won\u2019t be able to live on the child support, alimony, and your salary?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">CLIENT: No, that I think I can. I think... and I know, I think right now, I definitely can\u2019t live on just my salary. Like, that\u2019s, that\u2019s a very true statement. I can\u2019t. There is no way, because of my rent, you know. And daycare. Daycare is a big chunk, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re paying daycare? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">CLIENT: (affirms) Yeah, we, he is having me pay 35% of daycare, but his parents pay the rest of his share. So he doesn\u2019t want to pay daycare out of his wallet, I guess you could say. (pause) But I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to, I mean, I don\u2019t know if he would, like he\u2019d have to say that, I guess, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B1\">he gets money from his parents, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you actually do have to claim that. (client affirms) Do you think he\u2019s going to be honest about claiming money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (pause) I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">THERAPIST: He would, I mean, you\u2019ll find out when you meet with the mediator, but you\u2019ll have to figure out if you can actually do this mediation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, if he\u2019s saying like, he doesn\u2019t get any money from his parents... I know the only money he had, we\u2019ve always just gotten this money for daycare. They\u2019ve always given us like, $800 or $900, it\u2019s like $900 for daycare every month. They\u2019ve just always done that, and that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200831\">it. So I would be shocked if he goes in there and says he\u2019s not getting that. I would just be like, \u201cAre you really telling the truth? Because why would your mom stop paying it? (chuckles) Like, especially when you\u2019re going through a divorce. I would think your mother would keep paying it.\u201d What I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200832\">know is if his parents are giving him extra money every month. Which they could! I have no idea. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">THERAPIST: I think you, I imagine you would have to produce bank statements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I mean, yeah. I think, I just need to know the number. Once I have a number of how much I\u2019m getting, then I think I\u2019ll calm down. I think right now, I\u2019m just like, in this very unknown, financially, and it\u2019s like, making me nervous; <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200871\">like, super nervous... because I just, I mean, I don\u2019t know how... I can afford everything. There is no way. I don\u2019t make that much. I mean, he makes double what I make, so... I mean, his, the condo is a little bit more than my apartment, I think, but and he has a car payment. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200872\">paying daycare, which is like, a big chunk, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562656\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">THERAPIST: I imagine you\u2019ll get close to a third of his salary, in child support and alimony, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I would imagine they would, I just figure they would try to keep us like, more balanced, more like, even. So, yeah like, they would do that. And then he has to pay... yeah. My friend, my brother was like, \u201cYou should watch Divorce Court.\u201d It\u2019s like, this documentary and I watched the trailer <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B1\">yesterday. It looked horrible. It was terrifying. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not watching that!\u201d (chuckles) It\u2019s about these divorces that are in court for like, years; like, years! And like, that was the people who have to sell their possessions to like, pay for their fees and like, I don\u2019t want to do that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B2\">Although I will... I think I will sell my diamond rings very soon. I think once the divorce is final, then I\u2019m selling my diamonds. Right? Why keep them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">THERAPIST: (pause) If you don\u2019t want them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t! I always think, \u201cOh, I could give it to Brady. He could give it to his like...,\u201d but they\u2019re like, inscribed and everything. I could get a lot of money for them, I think. A friend gave me the name of a guy I could sell them to! (chuckles) But I could get at least, hopefully like, $11,000 <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F1\">or something for them. And they\u2019re just in my purse. I just walk around with them in my purse. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20091\">THERAPIST: You could probably also bring, because a mediator is there to help you not only financially, but just negotiate your relationship. (client affirms) And I\u2019m sure that she can help you with this issue around him. I shouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m sure she could help you, but I\u2019m sure you can bring up the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200911\">issue around him disclosing all this private information. I think that would be actually very helpful to talk about when you meet her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah, my friend had said that. She was like, \u201cYou should bring that up with the mediator, that he, you know...\u201d And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s, is it like, agreed upon that you don\u2019t... do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20095\">THERAPIST: Obviously, you can\u2019t regulate it or (client affirms) anything, but in terms of, a mediator is not just there to help you with the logistics. It\u2019s there, he or she is there to help you with the relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20097\">CLIENT: Oh, got it, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20099\">THERAPIST: Like, with the whole process (client affirms) and that\u2019s sort of what they\u2019re trained in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean... That would, I just, yeah, I think... and I mean, I don\u2019t know if he has said more to people recently. I mean, he seemed kind of concerned, when I was so upset about it. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s enough to... stop it, you know? (therapist affirms) But I will definitely bring that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B1\">up, because it\u2019s just like... it\u2019s just, no one wants to hear it, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D\">I mean, some people do, because they want to gossip about it. But, most people just don\u2019t want to know the details, you know. But yeah, I was going to bring that up. But I\u2019ll make a note of, I have to make a note of everything, just what I spend on the dog. I have to get a dog walker, because...

I adore him. He\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019ve had him for five years, but... I\u2019m just so... thinking I need to give him to... I have a co-worker who watches him when I go away. My co-worker is in his 50\u2019s. He and his wife love him and he loves them. They have a big house with a big yard in Greenwich. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A51\">She\u2019s retired, so she\u2019s home.

I mean, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s like, at least $100 or so a month, you know, just dog walker, dog food. This month, he\u2019s supposed to get all his shots, which is like, $375. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A71\">He has to get groomed.

Definitely okay about leaving, definitely... still need to deal with my parents <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF1\">like, they want me to come home next month, so... My brother was like, \u201cThey just want to talk to you.\u201d And it\u2019s like... It\u2019s going to be a really... difficult conversation, because he\u2019s like, \u201cThey just don\u2019t understand.\u201d You know, that mom was really upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B1\">Oh!

I just got back from California, things are, you know, I still need a few things in the apartment.\u201d He was like, \u201cWell, we really want you to come <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B11\">home. You know, your brother\u2019s 40th birthday and you know, it\u2019s good for you and Brady to come.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOkay. Well, can you buy my plane tickets, because I can\u2019t really (chuckles) buy them right now.\u201d He was like, \u201cYeah, yeah, we can do, you know, whatever.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562656\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B3\">Then... my mom was just like, \u201cHow\u2019s your handsome husband?\u201d And I was like... \u201cUh...\u201d She was like, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d And I was like, \u201cHe\u2019s at... he\u2019s at his condo. And so...\u201d And she just didn\u2019t say anything. So I\u2019m like, does she just like, not remember what\u2019s happening, you know? And then, later in <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B31\">the conversation, she was like, \u201cSo, I ran into our neighbor. Then she was asking when you and Rich would have a second child.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d And she just like... And then she just kind of laughed, and didn\u2019t say anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B5\">And I\u2019m like, looking at my dad, kind of like, confused. That was it. That was like, the only exchange in regard like, they didn\u2019t ask me anything. Like, my dad just said, \u201cHow are you?\u201d And that was pretty much it, but they didn\u2019t ask like, anything else about anything that\u2019s happening. So, it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B51\">a weird call. So I got off the phone and then I, you know, video-chatted with my brothers. One is in Nicaragua and the other one lives in Richmond, near my parents. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B7\">I was like, \u201cI had the weirdest conversation,\u201d and I told him and my brother Liam (sp), who lives in Richmond.

She was very <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B71\">upset like, an hour ago just like, sad about things and like, upset and...You know, she doesn\u2019t understand what happened. She said you guys looked so happy.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThen why is she saying that on the phone?\u201d And he was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just her way of like... I don\u2019t know.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B9\">And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s kind of messed up. Like, she... You know like, how, how\u2019s, that makes me feel kind of crappy. Like, why would she say that, you know?\u201d So it honestly makes me not want to talk to them. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if she realizes that, but...\u201d And I\u2019ll be happy to tell her, when I <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B91\">see her, but, they\u2019re like, very close to me not wanting to like, communicate with them if they\u2019re going to be like, weird like that, or critical or insulting, I just... like, I... I\u2019m trying to surround myself with less negative people (chuckles) and I don\u2019t want to like, not talk to my parents, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B92\">they\u2019re my parents. But I will do it, if like, they\u2019re just going to keep, make me feel like crap, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BB\">My brother was like, \u201cI know; they just need an explanation.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cListen; I will give them an explanation, but I\u2019m not going to keep talking about it every single day, because it\u2019s not about them.\u201d I was like, \u201cI understand they know Rich, I understand like, I\u2019m their daughter, but like, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BB1\">dissolving of my marriage has nothing, is not about them. Like, you know?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD\">And then my other brother, who lives in Nicaragua, he has never married. He\u2019s like, always has like, a long-term relationship and then it ends. He\u2019s with a girl now, but he\u2019s like... and he\u2019s the opp , you know, he travels all over the world. And he\u2019s like, \u201cYou have to do whatever makes (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD1\">you happy!\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019ve been there!\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re with someone, you realize you\u2019re not happy with them. Then you end it. It\u2019s hard and like, you don\u2019t need to tell everyone everything, you know. Like...\u201d So he like, is the opp , you know, he\u2019s really good in that sense, but... <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD2\">I just, I was like, I don\u2019t want to like have to... break it all, I mean I\u2019ll... I\u2019ll explain it, but I\u2019m not going to just keep talking about it, and have her try to convince me otherwise. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562656\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF\">I feel like that\u2019s what she\u2019s, my mom\u2019s, going to try to do, or my dad. And I explained to my dad, I was like, \u201cI think if everything goes well, we should be divorced in April, hope to God.\u201d And he was like, \u201cOh. That\u2019s fast,\u201d you know. I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah.\u201d (pause) I think they\u2019re just still trying to... <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF1\">tell me I\u2019m making... Like, convince me I\u2019m making a bad decision, so... They just don\u2019t listen very well, so... I feel like they\u2019ll ask me, and I\u2019ll tell them, and then they\u2019re going to keep saying, \u201cBut like, you need to think about Brady and...\u201d And every time I talk to them, I\u2019m like, \u201cBrady is <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF2\">fine. He\u2019s doing really well like... very happy like, normal like, nothing really different with him at all, you know, that I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d So... yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C1\">So, yeah. It\u2019s finances, my parents\u2019 relationship... and I\u2019ve been better this week about being like, alone, the alone thing, at least so far. It\u2019s only been like, two days (chuckles) three days this week, but... Like, Monday my friend came over and had dinner. Then last night I just watched a show, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C11\">and then my friend called me and I talked to her, so... So it\u2019s been a little bit better on that front. So, just trying to enjoy being on my own. (chuckles) Because my friend said that. She was like, \u201cWell, on the times when you\u2019re alone and you start to get a little anxious, just do something you like <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C12\">to do, you know.\u201d She was like, \u201cDo you like to watch TV? Or you want to like... watch a movie like, you can do at the house or, you know, do something.\u201d So... So I think I\u2019ve been like, working on that, just trying to be okay with being... by myself. I think I still have a ways to go, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C3\">So I\u2019m really looking forward to the mediation on Monday, and see what comes of it, and see what he says. He\u2019s such a finance person. I mean, I... foresee him being a pain in the ass about it. And I\u2019m not really organized with money in general. I mean, I\u2019ll pay bills, I just don\u2019t... he\u2019s like super... <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C31\">you know... But I mean, he\u2019s aware that I have to pay for things, because Brady lives with me, so... We could move to a cheaper place. I don\u2019t think that will be actually a real possible, because I\u2019ll eventually need a two-bedroom, because Brady is going to get bigger and I need a place where he has <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C32\">his own bedroom. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C5\">So, we\u2019ll see how it goes. I just want to know how much money I\u2019m going to get. But the good thing is I... I reached out and made a new friend. My son\u2019s best friend at school, I think I said, his parents are divorced. He\u2019s three as well. So I e-mailed his mom and I said, \u201cHi, our sons are friends at <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C51\">school, would you like to get together for a play date?\u201d She\u2019s like, a year older than me and she got divorced about a year ago. So I went to her place. She has a really nice apartment in Cambridge, and I was like, \u201cOh, my God!\u201d I have this tiny place in Falmouth.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N200C4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562656\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200C7\">So when I got there, I was like, \u201cOh, your place is really nice.\u201d She was like, \u201cWell,\u201d she was like, \u201cIt really helped, because once I got the alimony and child support, that made a (chuckles) difference.\u201d She was like, \u201cYou should have seen where I was living when I first left!\u201d Because she, she said <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C71\">the same thing.

Her <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C91\">husband does. But even she said, she was like, \u201cThis apartment is too expensive.\u201d It was like a three-bedroom apartment in Cambridge. She was like, \u201cThis is too expensive.\u201d She was like, \u201cI have to downsize at some point, but... She just wanted a place that felt like a house for her son.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200CB\">THERAPIST: She was a little further along than you (client affirms), and gave you a vision of what it could be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, when I walked in her place, I was like, \u201cI could have a, I could...\u201d Like, she seemed very settled, which was nice. Like, she... you know, it was like, what I liked about it was, it was nice in that it had a lot of rooms, but her stuff wasn\u2019t that ni .

She was like, \u201cYou\u2019ll be better, you know. This is just the tough part.\u201d You know, she asked me how Brady was doing. And she even said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200CF1\">she was like, \u201cSometimes when I\u2019m by myself, it\u2019s a little tough, you know, but...\u201d So I was like, \u201cWell, we should go out to dinner or something, you know.\u201d She was like, \u201cThat would be great.\u201d And then I saw her this week and...

But I can hear sometimes that you feel... like, I don\u2019t know if pressure is the right word, but you really rely on them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah, totally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Maybe sometimes, questioning your own judgment in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200E1\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah, I\u2019m a big like, \u201cWhat do you guys think?\u201d (pause) Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Rather than sometimes feeling secure in what you think is right for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200E5\">CLIENT: Right, right. Like, I... yeah. I\u2019m usually like, \u201cUh, I kind of want to do this. Do you think that\u2019s like, a good idea?\u201d And they\u2019ll... usually they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah!\u201d Or, you know, my one friend, Kayla (ph) is like, \u201cDo what you feel like you should do.\u201d Or that\u2019s kind of what she says to me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200E51\">She\u2019s like, \u201cThis is like... what this is about like, do what you think you want to do.\u201d She was like, if I see you doing something really dangerous, I\u2019ll tell you! (chuckles) But she\u2019s like, I don\u2019t think you will. So... And then I started my marathon, my half-marathon training, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200E7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s been nicer outside!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200E9\">CLIENT: I know! Because I ran this morning, before work. I ran yesterday, so I feel like I\u2019m kind of healing the mind and the body. We\u2019ll see how it goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Cool! (client affirms) We\u2019re going, we just have another minute or so left. I was going to ask you if you, talk about money, have you heard anything from the insurance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200ED\">CLIENT: No, I haven\u2019t. But I have a check, so I can write a check for... I think I owe like $700! (chuckles) or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Well, I was going to, I\u2019m happy to, you should actually have heard from the insurance. I would definitely call them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200F1\">CLIENT: Should I call them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I would definitely call them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200F5\">CLIENT: I submitted December and January, and then I just got, Janine (ph) just sent me February\u2019s. Although February\u2019s... for the... because we only had two sessions in February, one of them was the recorded one, but it was still the same price. Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N200F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562656\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N200F7\">THERAPIST: I can, yeah. I don\u2019t actually think I started to record (client affirms), but... Oh, do you have the consent form?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Oh, great. But that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll let her know. I\u2019ll let her know... what... know about that. I\u2019ll give you a revised rate. I\u2019ll give you the revised rate. You know, it\u2019s up to you. If you want to just, why don\u2019t you... why don\u2019t you call them. I mean, I understand that finances are really <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N200FB1\">tight (client affirms), so why don\u2019t you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N200FD\">CLIENT: I mean, I want to pay you! I don\u2019t want to like... make you work for free, either! So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N200FF\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay. Why don\u2019t you call them and find out what the story is for February.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20101\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll call them when I get back to my office. (therapist affirms) I have lunch with someone, but then I\u2019ll call this afternoon. Then I can e-mail you and Janine, and just let you know what they said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20103\">THERAPIST: Sure, because you should have, you should definitely have gotten reimbursement. It usually...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20105\">CLIENT: Because it\u2019s March! I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20107\">THERAPIST: Yeah, usually...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20109\">CLIENT: It said 30 days, so I figured well, it\u2019s been a little over, maybe... And then I got nervous that it went to my house, and that Rich like, took the money. So I actually just thought that, as I was driving here. But... And I can\u2019t imagine he would do that; that would be really messed up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Well, why don\u2019t you, find out what the story is. (client affirms) Yeah, I mean, I\u2019m like, I\u2019m fine if you have to wait to get reimbursed, just as long they are planning on reimbursing you, so... Then I\u2019ll make sure for... starting that second session, it\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll just go to the $40. <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2010B1\">So then, what we\u2019ll do is, you\u2019ll just sign over the insurance checks to me. (client affirms) And then it will be the $40 in addition. (client affirms) You know what I\u2019m saying? So rather than... so basically, I\u2019m going to get paid directly from the insurance after they, you know, starting at the end <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2010B2\">of February or whatever. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2010D\">CLIENT: So, so right... sorry. So right now, when I get the reimbursement, I\u2019ll deposit that into my account and then (therapist affirms) write you a check.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2010F\">THERAPIST: The reimbursement for January, and I guess the first session in February, if you want to do it that way. (client affirms) If you want to pay it, as, you know, again, if the difference is really big, let me know and I\u2019m happy to work out something (client affirms) more reasonable. But then <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2010F1\">after, starting when we, with the taping, then you\u2019ll just, when you get the reimbursement, you can just sign the check over to me, and then it will just be $40 for you on top of that. Does that make sense? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20111\">CLIENT: So... sorry. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m still confused. So then... the $40 ones, I\u2019ll still submit as an invoice like, I have been?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20113\">THERAPIST: Right. You submit. Well, basically, right now what we\u2019ve been doing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20115\">CLIENT: Will it list as $195?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20117\">THERAPIST: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20119\">CLIENT: Oh, okay. Well that\u2019s probably what she did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2011B\">THERAPIST: It will list... Yeah, she just doesn\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t told her yet, to adjust the fee. So you\u2019re going to get statements every month for $195 like, the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2011D\">CLIENT: No matter what, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2011F\">THERAPIST: And that you submit to the insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20121\">CLIENT: So then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20123\">THERAPIST: Then you\u2019ll get a separate statement from me, just for the $40 per session. So that you submit. They\u2019re not going to give you $195, they\u2019re not going to give you the full amount. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to give you. They\u2019ll give you something. But they\u2019ll give you... so whatever, <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201231\">from after like, after January, whenever we started, whatever they reimburse, you know, you can give to me, and then just $40 on top of that. But you\u2019ll still get the statements as is, because those still need to go to the insurance. (client affirms) Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N20122-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20122-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562656\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20125\">CLIENT: Yes. So then, just so I know how much then going forward will I be paying monthly? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20127\">THERAPIST: Well, $40 times how many...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20129\">CLIENT: Times we do it. (therapist affirms) So I\u2019m thinking maybe right now, should we just do it twice a month?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2012B\">THERAPIST: I mean, I think it, you know, it\u2019s up to you. Does $40 a session feel a little more than you can afford now, too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2012D\">CLIENT: I just feel like to pay... $160 a month right now is a little... I just, because I don\u2019t know how much I\u2019m getting and I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Well, hopefully, you\u2019ll have clarity starting next week. (client affirms) So... it\u2019s up to you. I mean, I\u2019m happy to see you, I don\u2019t want to have you go in the poorhouse (client affirms), I can really appreciate that. And again, if, for January, if the discrepancy between my fee and what <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2012F1\">they\u2019re reimbursing you is too big, I\u2019m happy to adjust my fee for that, even though we didn\u2019t start for the (inaudible) recording.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20131\">CLIENT: Thank you so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20133\">THERAPIST: But yeah. I mean, in general, it would be $160 a month, if we met four times a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20135\">CLIENT: So maybe, maybe for right, maybe for the next, maybe this next month, we\u2019ll do every other week until I know how much it is. Is that crazy to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20137\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay. I mean, honestly, if it has to be $30 a session, I mean like, I\u2019m really willing to work with you. I don\u2019t think I could do half (client affirms), but I\u2019m really willing to work with you, because I do want to con , you know, continue meeting consistently. So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20139\">CLIENT: I mean, we could... Well, let\u2019s, then let\u2019s keep it every week, and then I\u2019ll know Monday. So when I see you Wednesday, I could be like, \u201cHe is not giving me anything!\u201d (chuckles) Or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Well, I don\u2019t...think that will happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2013D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think that will be the case, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2013F\">THERAPIST: But yeah, just call the insurance and we\u2019ll figure out January and somehow...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20141\">CLIENT: Okay, I\u2019ll call them today and I\u2019ll e-mail you both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20143\">THERAPIST: Okay, because I understand that it would be very helpful for you to get, have the money from the insurance before you pay me for January.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s pretty much... And then, I also submitted some expense reports at work, because, and that\u2019s like... like, $800. So I was like, well, and they\u2019re going to give me that soon, so I was like, I could use that to pay that bill, too. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20147\">THERAPIST: Right.
