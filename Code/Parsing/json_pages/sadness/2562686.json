data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Good, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: You didn\u2019t go skiing, right? You said you weren\u2019t [INAUDIBLE].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no skiing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">[LONG SILENCE] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Can\u2019t figure out where to start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Are you curious about where I go when I go away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yes, I was curious. I don\u2019t want to be too nosy. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: What is, what do you mean by nosy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I mean, I wouldn\u2019t mind, you know, talking about where you went or what you did, but then, you know, I have to be professional, so it\u2019s not important or not important. It\u2019s OK not to talk really bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: You have to be professional?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I guess we should be professional. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s\u2014what is being professional?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I guess politely inquiring how your vacation was and then not digging for details. I\u2019m not digging, inquiring. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Well I have to be professional, however we define that. We can talk about that. Why do you have to be professional? You\u2019re not\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: If you\u2019re professional, then I\u2019m professional too. No? No? That\u2019s what I thought. In any kind of relationship, I guess, we\u2014that\u2019s, isn\u2019t that like one of the keys to a successful relationship, or not successful, but it\u2019s one approach to make\u2014figure out what the other person is\u2014how he\u2019s\u2014how they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">reacting to you and you react similarly. But it does restrict you, and I do feel restricted. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: But I guess that\u2019s how the world works. I don\u2019t know that\u2019s how adults are. I mean, I would love to chat about wherever you went, you know, if you were on a beach, what you read, and you know, but not asking makes me feel restricted and I guess restriction isn\u2019t necessarily like the (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">at 00:05:30). You call it boundary, that might be more positive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t really respect that many boundaries anyways, so\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: What do you have in mind when you say that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: What, when\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: That you don\u2019t respect many boundaries? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Well first of all, I don\u2019t understand them, then a problem with them and I, many boundaries I just kind of cross, so, especially like in relationships. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Are you, are you aware that you here, are you aware of worrying about crossing boundaries here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: A little bit, not that much. Because mostly what you do is talk, so you know, if we were doing a bunch of other things then there will be, there would be more boundaries, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Oh, I guess like if we were depending on each other for things, then I might have to be careful about it, you know, my expectations and not being impatient and not expecting too much and making sure I don\u2019t let you down with your expectations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: So if we were like in a social scenario.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Well I certainly hope you have some expectations of me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure what they should be, so I don\u2019t know, indulge them. But I\u2019m not saying, you know, like it\u2019s hopeless, it\u2019s not like that, obviously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: [SNEEZES]. Excuse me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Bless you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: And I certainly hope you depend on me, at least in some ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I depend on our sessions. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562686\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: It\u2019s mutual, like what we create or what we share. You\u2019re saying it\u2019s OK to expect and depend on people. I do, like I don\u2019t know. I guess I feel like maybe it came from a place of like depending too much and expecting too much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s like maybe I then ventured onto force myself to try not to depend and then kind of finding that I have to find that middle, that balance of not leaning too much but at the same time expecting and being hopeful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but it makes me think about whether you feel you\u2019ve been cautious in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: A little, but you have to be cautious every, with everyone, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well leaving that aside for a moment, because it seems like a hot issue, a sort of load that you can convert a lot of different ways, you certainly don\u2019t feel that with all of your relationships. I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking about, that you don\u2019t feel\u2014there are certainly relationships <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">you\u2019ve talked about not feeling cautious, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m sort of thinking about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: It seems like here, but not in all relationships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: What do you mean? Like with Chris I don\u2019t feel cautious?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve described several relationships where you feel like you\u2019re not cautious at all and that you feel like, you feel too impulsive, you know. You\u2019re saying things off the cuff or saying things that you feel clearly overstep boundaries, so I\u2019m sort of just comparing that with here where <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">I certainly don\u2019t experience you that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, not all my relationships are like that, but yeah, I guess I was talking to a friend awhile ago, and I was kind of defending my position, you asked me last week about that girl that I had a fight with so it\u2019s just like, but yeah, I want friendships like that where, you know, you can be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">a little, be yourself, or you know. Even may say things that you didn\u2019t mean and they\u2019ll bounce back, or they\u2019ll understand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: And this friend I was talking with, she was like, \u201cIs that how it works? I\u2019ve really learned the hard way.\u201d So I was thinking of that, and that\u2019s what I meant by knowing you have to be cautious. You can\u2019t assume things, so. But I mean, but then you can make mistakes, and that\u2019s fine. Where you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">think you are closed to someone after a certain point and then you do leg your guard down or you are less cautious and then they don\u2019t like what you say, and then you\u2019re like, \u201cOK, I guess I\u2019ll step back. I won\u2019t, I guess we\u2019re not as close as we thought, I thought we were, so.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: People can misjudge distances, so I guess I\u2019m trying to learn to be cautious the way that I guess I am here and I should, you know, take some of this level of professionalism to whatever relationships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: I guess I do, it\u2019s just that in certain scenarios there\u2019s so many other things going on that this kind of therapy or advice or whatever, you know I will call it, it just gets clouded, you know, like if I feel insecure or like all you know, the past comes like bearing down on me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Like reactions and impulses are all that I have to respond with instead of like this measured kind of professionalism that I\u2019m able to manifest here some way. So like feeling like an outsider, feeling that intense feeling, feeling judged, feeling insecure, like yeah. Sometimes I just respond <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">to those instincts. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562686\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">[SILENCE]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Just generally other things, being conscientious. Be like, you know, being in therapy or having these sessions kind of also in a sense help, because I don\u2019t feel like I have to talk about painful stuff with, you know, others, like I felt the need to do constantly before therapy, so, before I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">was seeing you, so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t feel the need because you feel you have a place to do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it\u2019s done in a productive way. It\u2019s not like it used to be where it was just like, I was like, I felt like I was just in the quicksand of yucky stuff. You know, like emotions and fast (inaudible at 16:27) experiences like just like it was watching a horror show that like keeps messing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">with your head, but even when you go away it\u2019s just kind of a submersion, but here it\u2019s not more like, it has, it\u2019s a narrative and you can keep it and analyze it and distance yourself from it somehow. So it\u2019s much more structured and productive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: And hence, helpful. Because yeah, last week a friend of mine, this guy I was helping with a PhD applications, I\u2019ve known him for like over a year, and I\u2019m a little upset with him because he\u2019s taken so much of my time, and last week I was really busy and the snowstorm hit us like Wednesday or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">something, and that same day I was going to meet him and then I walked in the slush and everything to see him. He was like, \u201cI have to tell you something.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d And he\u2019s like, and he told me that he\u2019s gay, so I don\u2019t know. I felt weird about it for a bit, for a few days, actually. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: I felt like a little betrayed or lied to because, you know, I lie all the time. I tell the biggest lies, but that doesn\u2019t make it OK when someone else lies to me. I mean, I understand why he did what he did, but you know, still. Because then I felt like, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t he have told me?\u201d Why didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">he, you know, like I\u2019ve done so much for him. I helped him so much, and I hope I haven\u2019t come across as too judgmental, at least not in this area, and he has all these other friends he can tell this to and not me. So he was like, \u201cYeah, I was feeling very guilty about not telling you and all my friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200772\">were like, \u2018You should really tell her.\u2019\u201c I guess, and then there\u2019s also this like residual like earlier I kind of had a crush on him for like a couple weeks or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: And I guess when I was like, I really told him that it was a silly thing that I said and then he didn\u2019t say anything back, so now I\u2019m like, \u201cAh, it wasn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t find me attractive, because you know, he\u2019s gay.\u201d So there\u2019s a bit of that. But I was trying to be sad about it. I was (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">at 00:19:41) trying to make myself cry, trying to like think in the sense that he didn\u2019t tell me this and why don\u2019t people like me enough, but I just couldn\u2019t pursue with that negative thinking, personally. I don\u2019t know why. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: I was trying to cry, but I couldn\u2019t, I was talking to (inaudible at 00:20:03) about it, but like, you know, I was trying to embody that profound negative space, a profound sadness but I couldn\u2019t and like, and he wasn\u2019t really listening but he was listening, and then I was like, \u201cYou know, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d And then I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s silly,\u201d and I didn\u2019t feel bad intensely, but previously this was, that would be, this is what I do like all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562686\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">I\u2019m like distance myself from everyone because I feel like I have this kind of superior understanding of the profoundly sad situation that they just don\u2019t, so you know, I feel, I actually like myself and then, so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: But I was very conscious of doing this, so then I couldn\u2019t do it. And I was thinking why do I have that need to feel, to (inaudible at 00:21:21) in that way, you know? I have a cultural need for having an intense and profound connection, but that itself is like such a fantasy or such an ideal, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">and in reality, you know, like moments of connection don\u2019t look like that, (inaudible at 00:21:59). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: So I guess I\u2019m trying to be conscious of that and trying to train myself to live in those moments or enjoy them more rather than just like my ideal, whatever that may mean. And I guess it was an intense moment when my friend told me, you know, he was, he kept saying, \u201cI can\u2019t even look you in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">the eye right now,\u201d and this and that. But I was kind of checked out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: We talked for like five and a half hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: About his being gay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: About his, you know, being in love with someone who doesn\u2019t love him back and it all makes sense now, I think. I think of how he feels, how he seems checked out and preoccupied. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: And on the edge a lot of the time, but now, so, I\u2019m like that\u2019s what it is. I can understand that, you know. That\u2019s what happens with, I guess it happens to everyone, it must, right? When, so you have this picture, this, you know, not picture, but you have like a desire for an intense connection, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">whatever that may be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: And like we\u2019re both connected, usual connection or sexual connection, or whatever, and when that moment actually presents itself, you get cold feet, you know, or you\u2019re checked out and you\u2019re too aware of the moment itself and you in it that you don\u2019t actually achieve, you know, like connection. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s contrived?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Why is it contrived?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Well I\u2019m asking, when you\u2019re describing it, something, I guess I was thinking about what you were describing having this very negative space and not being able to deal with it, and thinking last week wanting to have the negative space and achieve the connection. So the working tribe came <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">to my mind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: Because it sounded like you were trying to force yourself into that space, but it wasn\u2019t happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: No, that\u2019s one thing. I\u2019m talking about another, like when the moments do present themselves, like when my friend told me his big secret, it was a big moment, right? It was the kind of dramatic moment you write about, you know, like fictional moment. The coming out, you know, it\u2019s, from all <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">angles it\u2019s like a perfect, you know, material for a story. You know, like I\u2019ve known him for a year and a half, so it has all the materials of, you know, feeling afraid all that, you know. Like it was a big secret, and he consistently lied to me because he had to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: You know, and now I\u2019m trying to hook him up with women, and I say, \u201cGet married, it will help you.\u201d And he always had to say something, and that conveyed that he was straight, so I\u2019m just saying like that moment was an intense moment when we could have had like profound emotional connection, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">and maybe he feels that we did, but I feel like my experience with that moment was that I was checked out, like I was too aware of the moment, you know, that (inaudible at 00:26:37).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562686\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: You know like what I\u2019m trying to say, like you\u2019ve been presented with papers to your new house, like you\u2019re signing, and you, that\u2019s, you\u2019ve pictured that so often like signing on the line, but you\u2019re too aware of where the realtors put like the sticky thing instead of, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">a good analogy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: But I guess like even with intimacy, with good intimacy, that\u2019s what happens to me.

I mean, with Ari (sp?) that was the reason he literally threw me out, you know. His, he kept saying that I cringe and all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Cringe when he touched you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Well, not just touch, it was like much more than that, but I feel like, well now it\u2019s been so long, and maybe it\u2019s like psychologically I didn\u2019t really want him to because he was still Chris\u2019s friend in my head. He, I was doing everything and allowing myself, but with Chris, yeah, it happens. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">Not so much with (inaudible at 00:28:22), I don\u2019t know, because I guess I am like genuinely attracted to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like I train myself to be in the moment much more now than I did before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Do you feel checked out in here, like when you\u2019re quiet, is it checked out or is it something else? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Not all the time. When I\u2019m quiet I\u2019m either trying to think like building connections in my head of one thing leading to the other, or I am desperately trying to think but nothing is coming to mind because for whatever reason, or I really don\u2019t want to talk. Maybe the third scenario I\u2019m checked <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">out, but I don\u2019t feel like checked out, like it might be more like I\u2019m tired of talking or I need a prompt or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">[SILENCE]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: I feel like this is like totally new that I don\u2019t any more want to say those words. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: You wouldn\u2019t understand. I used to derive a lot of whatever feeling of isolation and weird superiority by saying these words, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand,\u201d but I feel like now it\u2019s like there\u2019s not much there. I get more joy out of being understood and sharing and understanding, actually, more <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">than finding this gem of information or emotion and like keeping it all to myself, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: I still have that kind of thing. It\u2019s not like fallen away completely. Holding to isolate, and in a negative like motivated by something negative. But that was like was slash is my fears of like you know, sitting in the same room with someone like a husband or a boyfriend or having any kind of connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: What does that mean not having any connection?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah, what does it mean? But seriously, like it\u2019s just like an image, and yet how important is it to put it in words because once I put it into words it\u2019s really not that dreadful or depressing. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562686\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Because I made it into a picture and that picture is like burned in my brain, and now I have to kind of unburn it, you know, toss it out and put it into words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: And what\u2019s the picture of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Well like me and my mom and Chris living in the same apartment and like me thinking oh, how depressing, how boring, how like awful, no connection, so but now I feel like that isn\u2019t the case, and sadly, that wasn\u2019t the case. I wish I realized that, you know. It\u2019s more like me doing my work, my <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">mom doing her work, Chris doing his work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: And sharing a sweet little apartment, you know, how nice that we were in our means. How nice that I was saving money. How nice that I was responsible and I knew both these guys\u2019 whereabouts all the time. You know, they were always apologizing that I didn\u2019t really see. People liked us, and (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD1\">at 00:34:38), and I threw parties and cooked, so I\u2019m not like sad about letting that go, because I have independence now. It\u2019s very, very expensive independence, but I have that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: I have that now, but I still like sometimes I feel that worried and if I\u2019m not worried then I\u2019m thinking, \u201cShould I be worried?\u201d Like if I\u2019m sitting in the same room as Sorab (sp?) or sitting in the car I\u2019m like there is that level of anxiety that \u201cOh God, the minutes are building up and we <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">haven\u2019t really talked.\u201d I guess that comes more from the fact that I\u2019m like, \u201cShould I be with Chris right now?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: We would be having such profound conversations. But I\u2019m like profoundness only comes once in a very long while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: There are lots of ways to be profound, though. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah, like how?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. You can have a profound connection that doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be around an intellectual idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: What else would it be about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: So many things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: People can have a profound emotional connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Like me and my mom?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: What comes to mind about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Well we have an understanding like yeah, that is a profound emotional connection.

Emotional. I don\u2019t know your list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t have a list. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you\u2019d like me to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Well it seems like the way your mother and you understand each other aren\u2019t the only way, the kind of way the two of you understand each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: That\u2019s fair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Do you think we can have a profound emotional connection?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Sure. I don\u2019t know. We have some profound psychological connection, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the distinction? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Emotional I think of as like it comes from having shared life together, so all the moments of, you know, like worrying about each other, watching each other\u2019s back, you know, like, yeah, sharing life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: You were, when you were first saying that I was thinking well we\u2019re not sharing our home lives for sure, but we share experiences together in here once a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200F2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562686\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah, but only my experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Maybe. I understand why you\u2019re saying that, but we\u2019re having a shared experience as we\u2019re talking about your experiences. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re sharing your experiences with me, but we\u2019re having a shared experience around that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah. That is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: What I started to think about, you were talking about restrictions and boundaries and boundaries are a positive way of describing restrictions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: And then one question, is there, are there some things that are just restrictive that are not a boundary, they\u2019re just restrictive? Or is it simply a matter of perspective? That is one thing I started thinking about. The other thing I started thinking about is that thinking about being connected <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201011\">in the context of having boundaries and what that looks like and what that means?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what that means, being connected in the context of boundaries. I guess that\u2019s what we have, right? I mean, there are boundaries here, professional boundaries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: I would say that in all relationships, that\u2019s true, that there\u2019s always boundaries. The boundaries might be different, and I started to think about maybe sometimes the boundaries feel like they block the connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I feel like I\u2019m at a phase now where I like boundaries. I completely (inaudible at 00:41:05) them earlier, and now I feel the need for them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">CLIENT: Like with Chris, with other people, I feel weirdly the need not to share, you know? Or to share different things. I do sometimes feel the need to share a secret when someone doesn\u2019t like have friends who don\u2019t know I\u2019m invading Sorab and have this need to like, you know. But then I have other <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201091\">urges too, like to share other things with them and like with other friends I have the urge not to tell them stuff at all. Like with Chris I feel like I have the urge to not lean on him and be strong and like be fabulous. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: In a like intellectual way or something. So connections and boundaries whereas earlier like I was just a mess, like I was like I had no backbone, I was just flopping about all over the place. So yeah, I think that\u2019s what I used to think, but oh, how can we have a connection? There\u2019s a boundary, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">but now I feel like ok, it\u2019s a challenge. It\u2019s like a race with hurdles now, so how do I, not necessarily like jump over the boundary, but try and have the connection, respecting the boundary. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: And boundaries can also enable connections. Like if there are two people who are completely boundary-less, how can you be connected? You\u2019re just an amorphous blob. I mean, not always. Sometimes boundaries do just separate people, but I\u2019m not always so sure. In a sense almost like what you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D1\">were saying, you weren\u2019t saying quite this, but we were talking before about how, you know, it\u2019s now can sort of shape, like painful things can be talked about in a productive way. It\u2019s like the boundaries of this, sort of our experience together can enable that, which is a particular kind of connection. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: what do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: Well I thought one of the things you were saying is that, well you weren\u2019t quite saying, but as that, you know, this relationship has, as all relationships, (inaudible at 00:44:15), but then it allows you to be connected to all different parts of yourself and to me, in a way that it was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201111\">kind of, it was almost like a repetitive re-traumatizing that was going on before that didn\u2019t really feel like it was really connected to anything, it was just pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20110-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20110-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562686\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: It was connected to pain, but no meaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah.
