It's just very unusual for Time seems to be like the thing that you are always on top of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Like you always start on time and end on time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: And end on time. Yeah, you know I'm s Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: It's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I'm s I didn't mean to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I am really not upset about it. Just noting the unusualness of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Oh good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: So I feel a little bit like I am coming here to ask for help and I don't exactly know what I want help with, if that makes sense. It's sort of like So maybe I'll just list some things that are going on in general, and then say, \"Help.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: (sigh) So I feel like I am angry a lot of the time. Not like outwardly angry necessarily, but just feel angry. I feel sad but that's less at the surface than angry. I feel a little bit lost in terms of like I lost of track of how to maybe even have desires, but like weigh them in a reasonable <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">fashion against, particularly against Tanya's. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">But it is feeling more like a general problem of like not being sure how to find an optimal outcome or find an outcome that I would want. (pause) I feel like process things more slowly right now, so I feel like I'm thinking more slowly and less able to articulate what I want to say, in a general sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">And I think that's related to having feelings that I'm just angry a lot of the time. And it's not hard to tap into that. And so the leaving that alone part and continuing to have another sort of conversation takes some effort that takes away from the actual conversation part, I think. (sigh) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">I think those are the main feeling parts of it in a sense. (pause) I'll probably finish my degree by the end of the year, which means I'm going to have to figure out what I'm going to next. Which is itself an optimization problem that has all of these other particular difficulties that I've just been <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">talking about of like it's hard to think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">I'm not exactly sure what I want. Not being exactly sure what I want in that career sense is not a new thing particularly. We've talked about it a little bit before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: But I guess I felt in the past like it's something I needed to deal with eventually. Eventually I'll need to figure out exactly what I'm doing next, but the time scale is longer. Now it's sort of like, well I really need to have some clear sense of what I want to do next. And probably after <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">that, because the optimal next step depends on where I'm trying to go after that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: But really I'm not well equipped to do it. That's a little bit of an overstatement because I feel like Tanya is doing better and quite well really. And I can talk to her about what she needs and wants and how we should balance her needs and mine. So we've had some of those conversations and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">they went surprisingly well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: I think another piece of it is I'm probably afraid somewhere in there that it's all going to happen again. Because there's no clear reason why it happened in the first place. Or that's not really fair. I can tell a lot of stories about why it happened, but I can't tell a story that's good enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">to predict when it will happen again.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559584\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">And so, in that sense, there's no clear reason why it happened. And so that's something that I feel like has to play into what I do next. Because it's not the case in all jobs that I can move across the country and stop doing some major portion of it so that I can take care of my ill spouse. It's just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">not how most of the world works. I'm very lucky to have been where I was when I was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Help. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Help knowing what to do with all these problems? Or where to even start? Decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I feel like they're similar questions. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What do feeling angry about? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: That's a hard question because I can feel angry about almost anything, but it's not really like, I don't feel like it is in some sense the root cause of the anger. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: And that is a little bit harder for me to figure out. So it's like, you know, someone is driving very, very dangerously on the highway swerving in and out of traffic. I can be angry about that and more angry than I would normally be because I find endangering others to be not a nice thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: But I feel like it's compounded by some other residual anger. So I feel like the question that you may really be asking is, \"Why am I residually angry most of the time.\" And I'm less clear about that. I think it has to do with feeling betrayed and abandoned in this marriage. Feeling like she <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">doesn't remember things and so it's <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">I think I feel guilty about that because it happened while I was the only one of the two of us that was really aware of what was going on. I couldn't really have stopped it, I think that's pretty clear, but it happened. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">You know I moved across the country in a sense because she kept wanting to kill herself. We kept making changes. Like, \"I'll take an incomplete in this class and then take a little time and then finish it later in the summer.\" Well, \"Take a leave of absence from your program.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">And then that really wasn't working. She couldn't find a job. She couldn't find a job that she wanted to do because, of course, they weren't going to cover her health care or pay her while she's taking a leave of absence. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">I don't know that moving here made things any better. I don't know that they made it any worse either. But there's sort of this sense in which like I did this really big in heart thing and I'm not sure it was worth anything. But that hasn't stopped it from being hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">And even if it was worth something, she's still withdrawn from her PhD program, can't remember why she did that, and upset about having done it. So ultimately that was probably the thing she needed to do most. So I guess that I should probably just be mostly happy about that. But (pause) So I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">like I haven't answered your question really. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: I think you're doing fine -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: with it. Well, you started what you just said, you prefaced it with saying, \"I feel betrayed and abandoned in my marriage.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's probably right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: I've tried to tell some of my friends this because it seemed like a large enough thing like that I was angry in this position. It seemed like a large enough thing that I wasn't dealing with on my own very well. And that even talking with you was, in some sense, not acknowledging it enough or <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">something like that. Or it seemed like it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559584\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">I'm not sure that's correct, but that's how it seemed. It seems to be a hard thing to hear. And I'm not sure whether I just can't articulate it or whether I (pause) I think there's a sense in which if you're not in my position, Tanya being well again is just a really good thing. Full stop. And it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">is a really good thing but it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: But it also isn't good that she was sick to begin with to be well from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, that. And the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: And who knows the pattern?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: The pattern, which is what you Who knows the pattern?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And also like the way she was sick I guess I dealt with much more than anyone else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: And so there's a sense in which that's like behind most people. It's sort of like, \"Well, she's well again. We can leave that behind.\" I don't seem to be able to just leave it behind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Well how could you? It's left you with so many hurt feelings and lingering questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: I would be far more concerned if you left it behind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: (laughs) Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Because it would mean to me you weren't processing things. \"Oh great, it's sunny today.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: That is nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: But if you just went through a war, it's nice that it's sunny, but it doesn't erase everything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Okay. (pause) How does it get better? (pause) (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: (sigh) My very trite answer, it's really trite, is by doing this. I mean, in a sense, by processing it. Unpacking all the complexity of it both, you know, in terms of your feelings and in terms of your thoughts, and in terms of your thoughts about the future and what your future looks like. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">The meaning of it. It's right now really still something that happened to you. It's a little bit more than that, but mostly that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: As opposed to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Sort of what it means. What the impact You know, sort of the, you know Yeah, the implications, the meanings, the feelings. It's just something that This is also not a great way of putting it, but it's sort of still a traumatic event that's not integrated. Because it just happened not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200971\">because you're failing to integrate it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Right. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: The identity of your marriage. You know? I mean (pause) I mean like when your house is burning down, which is kind of an interesting metaphor that I thought about this, you have to put the fire out. What you're going to do about the house, your attachment to the house, I mean that's not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">things you think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">You've got to try to put the fire out so there's some semblance of a house left. But then there's all those other things to deal with. Do you recover? What can you recover from the house? What do you need to build anew? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: (laughs) Right. Right. (pause) Yeah, I think that's right. I feel like you understand where I am pretty well. So, thank you. (pause) Most of the, it may be trite, but the answer of about continuing to do this is a path forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559584\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: It's a good, it's a helpful thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause) Yeah, maybe trite isn't Probably what I meant is it's not fully, it's not a full explanation of this but it's, you know, it's a little bit amorphous to describe it that way. I do believe that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: That's good. (laughs) (pause) Do you think people do your job that don't believe that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: I don't know.

Well it is an interesting question of, do people do things they don't believe in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Well, maybe that's the way in which it's not that far afield of what we're talking about. What do I have to do next?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.

Which is going well right now in the sense of I'm actually going to finish my degree. (laughs) That's a good thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: That's a huge thing. When you say at the end of the year, are you meaning December?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Not the academic year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: No. In between. But the next step in biomechanics is if I want a faculty job is to do a post doc. And those start in a sense randomly, but between semesters is as good a time as any.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: But then the question is, do I actually want that career path? How do I feel about taking a job where someone else is going to take all of the credit and do very little of the work, but provide most of the funding. (pause) Uncomfortable, at best, but I've had other friends try to do other things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C31\">besides a traditional academic post doc. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">And the one friend I'm thinking of is doing okay. He has a faculty job, it's just not at a very school and not with a lot of resources. And it's not where he wanted his career to be. But (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: I guess I feel like I'm in a place where the next steps, that I have to rebuild my marriage in some sense. It's just been shaky in a fundamental way. Tanya is turning back into the person that I married, but she's catching up to who she is faster than I am in some sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: I'm still aware of who she's been recently. In a sense she's lucky because she doesn't. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: She doesn't feel lucky not to remember anything about the last several months and large pieces of the last couple of years. But (pause) they were not good times. They were bad enough that she wanted to kill herself. So maybe it's better she doesn't remember them. (sigh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: So her responsibility is, of course, a weird thing in that world. Like if she doesn't have any real understanding of or consciousness of it, what responsibility does she bear for it now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: And (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Maybe she has a responsibility of knowing and bearing in mind what you're experience of that was. Appreciating the impact of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: But knowing how much? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry, knowing how much? Knowing refers to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: You said maybe she has the responsibility of knowing what she's done, what the impact has been on me. But at what level of detail?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559584\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I see. (pause) At what level of detail should you share? Is that the question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that's, you know, complicated by me still not entirely trusting her. Because I have this concern that if I share every level of detail, she will not be able to handle it. And then we'll be right back where we were when it was bad. Which is part of the trust problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: [I should] (ph) probably rephrase this. How do I have a relationship with someone I don't really trust? To which I would just respond, \"I don't really want to have a relationship with someone I don't really trust.\" It's just not how I want to be in a relationship, but (pause) here I am. (sigh) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E71\">(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">You know I don't monitor almost every move she makes any more. So that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">(long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: I don't make sure the knives are always washed and put away so that they aren't like out as a temptation anymore. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Does she know you think about these things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Well if you don't tell her, she probably doesn't. I don't know, maybe that's not a good assumption.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: No, it's probably right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">(long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: But, you know, It's hard enough to say these things in your general direction when I know that you can handle them, more or less. And I'm really not sure about her. And they're hard for me to say. You know, I think you're right. I do need to say them to her, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">But I think there's a part of me that's irritated that I have to rebuild trust or intimacy or something like that. It's a hard thing to do in the first place (pause) and now it's, in a sense, redoing it under duress. (pause) I don't have anything more to say at the moment, so if you have a thought. (sighs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">THERAPIST: I was just making different analogies in my head and trying them on for size and then seeing if there's I was thinking about being married to someone with alcoholism. And at what point do you get rid of all the alcohol.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">And then clearly probably, you know, getting drunk in front of your spouse who has an alcohol problem, that's probably not (laughs) advisable and probably irresponsible one might say. But then at what point do you extrapolate to, \"It's your responsibility to have them not drink?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">THERAPIST: Do you, maybe you get rid of all the alcohol in the house. Maybe you petition to have all the stores in your town not sell alcohol. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">THERAPIST: You know, you can sort of extrapolate out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">CLIENT: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">THERAPIST: But you're describing these layers of burden. Just burden of bearing what happened. The burden of and the anxiety about sharing it with her. I mean, just like sort of layers of burden. And, you know, sort of what you were saying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">I mean, I agree with you and I do have an opinion on that sharing with her, whatever the timeline is, the impact that her suicidality, multiple hospitalizations and ECT has had on you. I think without that I don't think you'll feel good in your marriage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">CLIENT: Hm. (pause) Okay. I think that's probably right. (pause) There's probably a sense in which I don't really want that to be the answer. I guess it would be nice if there was a, if it were easy in some sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2010E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559584\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">CLIENT: But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: I mean this experience was deeply traumatizing. It was a traumatic experience in your life. And in some ways, not that I would want to put a quantitative mark on it, but in some ways more so than hers. If only because she doesn't remember a lot of it. I mean that itself is traumatic for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">THERAPIST: So I don't want to minimize it. Maybe I don't even want to make it qualitative. It's just so different. It's just a very, being her and being you in this experience is just extremely different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">THERAPIST: But traumatic for you. Traumatic for anybody. I'm not saying this happened to have been traumatic for you. This is a traumatic event, series of events.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">THERAPIST: Over time. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">And actually your process kind of very much is in line with how sort of people process trauma. That during the trauma you're more recounting what is happening, which is what you were doing. You were sort of recounting and recounting. You were sort of like going over the details, going over the facts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">Not that that's what you were only doing, but that's a big piece of it sort of while it's happening, is sort of shortly after. And then when you get a little bit more breathing room, a little bit more distance from it, that's when you can sort of understand the meaning and the feelings and so forth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">CLIENT: Hm. (pause) Yeah, it also has, having had traumatic experiences in my life before and we've talked about some, that there's a difference here in that there's no closure to the event. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">CLIENT: So it's not a thing to walk away from and make peace with over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">CLIENT: It's a thing to continue to live in and make peace with over time. And I have a much less clear idea of how to do that. You know, my volleyball coach drove into a tree. Like I can be angry with him for driving into a tree, but I'm certainly not hurting him by being angry with him. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">CLIENT: You know. (sigh) (pause) I feel like this a more complex event to attempt to process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">CLIENT: Because, as you have been saying since before I was saying it, because of the implications for our future. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Mm hm. (pause) And the more immediate one that's coming up is sort of practically. I mean it has sort of emotional pieces to it, but in terms of what you're going to do next, keeping this mind as you were saying, there were certain situations where flying across the country would not <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201391\">have been an option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's also like, it is in a sense a practical decision or other practical things of high importance to weigh in. Like there's a relatively small set of places that I could go that don't bound my career paths in some way. How far can we reasonably go from Or where can we reasonably go <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B1\">that Tanya will have the continuing care that she needs or wants or needs or wants. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">THERAPIST: There are a lot of places that you can go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">THERAPIST: I mean if you get an academic position in some place extremely rural, though it would be less so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">THERAPIST: But for the most part in the US there are a lot of places for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">CLIENT: Okay. (pause) I feel like there are some entire states that have dramatically less good health care systems. We were in Ohio where she was hospitalized first. They said that she probably wouldn't be able to see someone for six months if she were just coming in under normal circumstances. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201471\">it seems like not great.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20146-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20146-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559584\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">So fortunately I don't really want to go back to Ohio, so that's not an issue. But (pause) But yea, this is just in a sense the immediately appearing practical concern. It makes all of the feelings and difficulties about rebuilding and living forward come up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. You know one thing I was thinking about, and you probably know this anyway, but if you've ever felt that coming in an additional time a week for some period of time to help make sense of this and process this. If you felt that would be helpful like please let me know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">CLIENT: Okay. Thanks. I really want to have a clear sense of what would be helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I've thought about it over the last month or so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20151\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">THERAPIST: I sort of wondered whether that having an additional time each week to talk about these things, at least for some period of time, especially in the sort of midst of it. You're just so in the midst of processing what happened and making decisions about your future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">I mean that's an awful lot. And having, you know, an additional time and space each week could helpful. But I don't have any strong opinion on it but it's certainly been something I've thought about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">CLIENT: Okay. Thanks. I don't think I had thought about it very much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">CLIENT: So will think about it some. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">CLIENT: It's definitely helpful to be seeing you and to be coming here. So, yeah, I'll think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not really sure where else to go at present or what else to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">CLIENT: Or talk about. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">THERAPIST: Well, let's see what comes up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Where your mind goes. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">CLIENT: (laughs) Unfortunately, the place that that goes is that I know that when Tanya comes to a moment in therapy where she's not sure what to talk about, Chad says, \"What comes to mind?\" Tanya has a hard time dealing with that question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">CLIENT: So (laughs) that (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">THERAPIST: Well I'm always sort of happy to chime in with something, you know, share my thoughts. Sometimes I like to let those moments go a little bit because you may be working on something you don't realize you're working on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">CLIENT: Fair enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">THERAPIST: So I like to like, \"Well let's see if something emerges.\" But I don't mean to be sort of mystical about it (laughs) or, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">THERAPIST: But that's sometimes why I don't chime in right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">CLIENT: No. And I really appreciate it. And I am sure it's hard to tell from me sitting here staring at that wall whether I'm thinking about something or nothing at that moment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">CLIENT: And sometimes it's one and sometimes it's the other, so I appreciate that. Today I don't really, I don't seem to be going anywhere in particular. So if you I mean, it's sort of like you have been saying things to me and I've been saying,\" Yes, that sounds about right.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">CLIENT: Which itself is helpful because I feel like you're presenting it clearly and it helps to understand it or hold onto it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20186-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20186-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559584\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">CLIENT: And it's also helpful just to have a sense that, \"reasonable\" isn't the right word, but that like I'm on some sort of path that looks vaguely like what other people might have gone through under similar circumstances. If that makes sense. Sort of like (pause), in a sense, yes, these feelings <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B1\">are to be expected. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">What exactly they look like, that depends somewhat on me and somewhat on the circumstances. But it's not at all surprising that we are here at this moment because I think I feel like some of my friends and family are surprised that I would be not just happy now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">CLIENT: Not that they don't understand it quickly, I don't think, when I start explaining. But I don't think that it's like occurred to some of them that Tanya being better now isn't just Tanya being better. There's still everything else to deal with. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">THERAPIST: Well, to use the war analogy again. It's sort of like if you, you know, get to come home from Afghanistan, you were still in Afghanistan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">THERAPIST: You may not be there now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">THERAPIST: And then if there's the uncertainty, \"Will I sent back again. I don't know.\" It's not fully comforting and settling and \"yay\" all roses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And home looks like a different place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">CLIENT: I think is what a lot of people find.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">CLIENT: Which is definitely where I am at present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">CLIENT: A practical question. You've suggested that we should do couples counseling. On what time scale? Like when should we start?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">THERAPIST: (cross talking at 00:46:45)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">CLIENT: Is that something I should decide? Is that something we should decide together? I mean there's still that part of me that doesn't want to have to be rebuilding. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Right. So the question you're asking is an emotional question more than a practical question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">CLIENT: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Practically, whenever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">THERAPIST: I mean, go next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">THERAPIST: You know, I have a couple of great people I'd be happy to send you to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">THERAPIST: By next week. But, right, you're talking about an emotional question, both about, you know, \"Why do I have to be doing this?\" And also, \"How can I fully trust that Tanya's going to be able to hear what I have to say without falling apart?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">THERAPIST: Those are all I mean, I guess the latter can be somewhat of a practical question, but a practical question that really doesn't have any clear answers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">CLIENT: Fair enough. Fair enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">THERAPIST: So my immediate response is, \"Yeah, whenever.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">CLIENT: (laughs) Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">THERAPIST: But maybe the ancillary question is you're feeling, \"When will I be ready?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's the question I'm trying to ask. And is it okay if I'm not ready now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">CLIENT: Because it seems like part of the answer to the first two emotional questions you asked is well, \"You just have to start doing it.\" Like, that's how trust works as far as I can tell. You just start doing it and then you build it over time. And so I feel like part of the purpose of the therapy <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D11\">is to of the couples counseling, couples therapy is to do that. The process is how it happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. I need to let you know, we need to stop for today.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559584\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D5\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Sorry about the lateness. I was going to ask. I can totally do the 10:45. For July and August it would work a little bit better if we could meet earlier. And if not, that's fine too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D9\">CLIENT: No, we definitely can. That would be great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Okay. Well, if you can do the nine o'clock, my schedule shifts a little bit for the summer. But if you can nine o'clock that would be great. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">THERAPIST: Is that good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">CLIENT: That would be fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E3\">THERAPIST: [Let's just keep it that.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E5\">CLIENT: Okay, great. I'll see you next week then at nine. Okay.
