(long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: It\u2019s hard. (long pause)  Maybe you can help me figure out what\u2019s really bother me.

(long pause)  On Monday I walked home with Kelly from school like three miles. (pause) It\u2019s been really nice would be in touch with her a lot more lately. I\u2019ve been avoiding her for a couple of weeks. I got back from San Diego and she sort of found me.  I decided <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">that it\u2019s time to write my clinical paper and let go of trying to find a shiny stone because the technical challenges are too . . . basically, I\u2019ve solved them and I actually know that there aren\u2019t any shiny stones. What\u2019s left to be solved is of interest to you, sort of like the technical audience\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">sheet. There are two papers, the clinical paper and the technical paper. Now (inaudible at 00:07:41).  I sort of felt cut loose, given permission to go into another phase. I\u2019m sort of trying to bond with this clinical paper and it\u2019s kind of disappointing; but it\u2019s very, very important, so that\u2019s been <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">hard and it\u2019s an important result clinically, but it\u2019s not super exciting.  The technological advances that are . . . (phone vibrates) Sorry. Do you know how \u201cdo not disturb\u201d works?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve never used it. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t seem to know how to use it. You turn it on and you turn off, press the top button, and it\u2019s supposed to not disturb you, but then you get buzzings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: You get disturbed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yes. It\u2019s been on. I\u2019m very happy that she\u2019s calling. I\u2019m not disturbed, which is fine. It\u2019s not working how it\u2019s supposed to.  I have my phone here because I have notes on Jeremy. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m smiling because it\u2019s a little funny for me to think of you having notes on Jeremy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yes, because he wrote to me Monday afternoon in a conversation about himself and therapy and I wanted to honor his words. So I guess they\u2019re his words; they\u2019re not mine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: That totally makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yes, I have notes on Jeremy. (pause) I found out this week that the collaborator in New Zealand\u2019s mother is having open heart surgery, so in making this critical paper I\u2019m now wanting to know a lot more information about the patients that I can only get by talking to the doctors and the head <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">doctor is sort of unavailable because she\u2019s with her mother.  So that feels like it stalls the paper and being stalled and writing a paper is my natural state in writing papers. This is my first one that I\u2019ve really committed to writing with some amount of urgency and focus, but I\u2019ve had two other opportunities <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">to write before. Would-be papers are just sitting there and it\u2019s been three years for one and two years for another.  So I have this sort of baggage around it. It feels bad to feel like this when I stall, when it feels really important to get it done for morale and also for practical, like being persuasive <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200293\">about when I should be able to graduate kind of stuff. (pause)  Kelly sent me this cool link over the weekend about the Museum of Natural History in Los Angeles and how they have a comparative genomics research group. She was like (inaudible at 00:14:02). She sent me the link. I was so pleased because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200294\">one fantasy that\u2019s very old for me is like having a job that has something to do with a museum, creation, teaching, research \u2013 especially a museum that appeals to all ages and all types of people, like that one.  So it was exiting to have her feel like she knows me well \u2013 and she should know me well. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200295\">So on our walk home we talked about all sorts of things. She sometimes comes to me and shoots the shit about stuff that feels like she knows I will be able to talk about with her. Earlier in my day I was talking about my grandfather and my parents and briefly about my dad\u2019s struggle and she talked a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200296\">lot about bringing her husband\u2019s parents to live with them and she was up in the middle of the night thinking about how they would actually do it, how there is exactly four houses in Waltham that are bigger than hers at all and she has a three-bedroom house.  She has this weird way of talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200297\">things in terms of . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562492\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t understand. She has a three-bedroom house?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: She needs a bigger house if her in-laws are going to come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: So she\u2019s being in her blog saying \u201cfour bigger houses in all of Waltham than mine.\u201d Like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, but her point was I\u2019ve looked and there are four and they are like $1.1 million and $3.2 million. She has this strange way of talking about very tender, complex things in terms of \u201cI can\u2019t move to Providence.\u201d (laughs)  Like a sort of shock shock, a sort of tagline that she will seize <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">on and be this dramatic thing. I tried to engage her about the complex stuff. I was like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s pretty mixed to have your in-laws around, I imagine.\u201d She was like, \u201cYeah, I kind of hope that his dad dies first.\u201d We talked about that. So anyway, that was the history of it. She sometimes comes around <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">and asks people if they want to walk home and no one ever really does, takes her up on it. I\u2019ve walked to school with her in a snowstorm and Jeremy has walked home with her in a snowstorm, but that\u2019s all I know. But this time, she came around and asked me and I had my bike and was like, \u201cI have my bike,\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">so I sort of chased her down while she was leaving and said, \u201cCan I walk my bike home with you?\u201d and she said \u201csure.\u201d I walk my bike home with you?\u201d and she said \u201csure.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">We talked a lot about her children and her in-laws and my brother and Jeremy and the museum job. She wanted to know what I liked about that vision because I just didn\u2019t really know, but I said that I thought it was appealing to me about a general kind of job like that. She was like, \u201cI\u2019ve been fantasizing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">for you about this whole thing and this whole fantasy.\u201d That was very nice of you.  Her fantasy has to do with the museum thing as this really unique opportunity. She knows the people who run it and her fantasy that she shared with me involved this game, like a post-doctoral training thing where I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">basically just make space for myself and convince them that they want me to stay forever. I think that\u2019s a feasible fantasy. My fantasy is like avoiding transition at all and like someday I\u2019ll be ready to apply for a job that\u2019s more than a threeor four-year commitment and that\u2019s one of the jobs that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200333\">I would apply for.  For example, if I did a post-doc it would be after that. So this was very dramatic because we were crossing the Mass Ave bridge this time, which is long. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562492\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">All of this separation anxiety came up for me as we were comparing our different visions and I feel remorseful that this is sort of what I had to say to her at this time after sort of such an exciting \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 whatever thing that she shared with me.  I felt like it kind of feels like Jeremy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">and I are both working on stuff. I don\u2019t really want to move right after I\u2019m done here. She was like, \u201cWell, yeah. Maybe it would be a year from now until you\u2019re really, really done.\u201d I think that this nebulous time thing is really causing me a lot of stress \u2013 like is it six months? Is it a year? Is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200352\">it up to me? Is it up to her? Is it up to my committee?  It\u2019s starting to feel like it\u2019s time to go. Time to go, but this is one of the confusing things that I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what\u2019s bothering me or if it\u2019s something else. So her attitude was like well, this is kind of one of those opportunities <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200353\">where you have to let it take you where it takes you because it\u2019s kind of like how many Museums of Natural History comparative genome assistants do you know? There are none in the world, so I think she had a big message, which is like you might consider letting it unfold without trying to fit it into <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200354\">a certain time.  But she also supported the idea of showing up in five or seven years and saying, \u201cHey, you want to hire me?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">In my head I\u2019m thinking that Kelly is making me leave Josh. Kelly is making me move to Los Angeles. I\u2019m on a bridge. It\u2019s windy. It\u2019s fast. And I have to choose between my job and Jay. I was really overcome by it.  I was going to sort of proliferation in a preoccupied way like well, maybe Jay would <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">still meet? Maybe it could work. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have to stop seeing him. There are a million analysts in Los Angeles. Why wouldn\u2019t I be an iconic Los Angeles analyst patient? It\u2019s like that\u2019s one vein, and then it was also overcome by it with just that I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want to do it at all. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">(pause) Like get me out of here. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">Later on in the walk, she let me in on her very, very strong feelings about how being a stay-at-home mom is a total trap, but it also made a big impression on me. It was very hard to hear such a narrow view from her because I think she means a lot, so that everything that happens between us means a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">whole awful lot and it\u2019s hard to let go of. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: You have this whole inner life that she doesn\u2019t know about, but still somehow I guess you kind of have to be a little ready to take off with her on her ideas for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s very seductive. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready or if it\u2019s right to just take off with her, but it\u2019s seductive.  Seductive to have an hour of her time on a walk. She has twin eleven-year-olds at home. She\u2019s so busy and she has a fantasy about me. She\u2019s been thinking about me. That\u2019s pretty great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s the right one in the realm of me that she knows about. There is not a lot that\u2019s getting left out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562492\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: But there is, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: In what she knows about me or . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: What I have in mind is her not knowing how much you don\u2019t want to leave her and how there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, I guess. Everything going on on the walk is, I guess, seductive and also is making you feel close to her and I think like you want to stay with her, except that what you\u2019re talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">about, which I think she had. My impressions were how you tell it somehow, she doesn\u2019t see that part of it, which is how it will have a huge effect on you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: In all my interactions with her and what I\u2019ve seen of her, she would rather not give any space to that part, that people feel good when they\u2019re close. There is actually this very weird \u2013 like she\u2019s so clinically savvy. She\u2019s so charming and high-ended appropriate with the people that she needs <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">to be with. And with her labs, she\u2019s sometimes very, very nasty. And over the years, many of us have sort of developed \u2013 this is what I think and people I\u2019ve noticed the same thing.  She has this sense of real intimacy with us. She really, really feels like you\u2019re a part of her family and so she doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200492\">need to spend any time on formalities or making it clear that she cares or stuff that\u2019s important, especially to \u2013 to anyone. Like \u201cyou\u2019re doing a good job\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m proud of you\u201d \u2013 that sort of stuff. There is a lot of skipping to the whatever. We\u2019ve sort of tried to train her to use the sandwich technique, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200493\">which she is just awful at. She still can\u2019t do it. She doesn\u2019t understand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: The sandwich technique is where you say something positive and then you put in your criticism and then you say something else positive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but the positive things should be sort of meaningful and constructive as well, but her bread just sucks. She doesn\u2019t get it. She\u2019ll say like, \u201cIt was a good talk, but . . .\u201d She\u2019s never done this to me with respect to a talk, but she\u2019s done it to me in other ways. Yes, I am sad about leaving <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">her, but I really don\u2019t want to be in her lab anymore. (pause) But I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Let me be clear. I\u2019m not missing the part about you not wanting to leave me either, I just had some (inaudible at 00:32:08). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Okay. (pause) It\u2019s very nice that you said something about something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: Just then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, like that you said something about my leaving Sarah first and not my leaving you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Sometimes it feels like it\u2019s just so me-centric here, in part because I\u2019ve hired you to deal with it, but also in part that\u2019s how I actually feel.  For me it is you-centric except today and at other times, it\u2019s not always you-centric. Today there is this very charged [mix.] (ph?) Kelly also <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">came up with this hair-brained idea that I should go to New Zealand, if [Carson\u2019s] (ph?) attitude about the paper is too slow. She tries to send people places.  I think it\u2019s a great thing. She\u2019s been successful with several other people in the lab, but that is the last thing I want to do. Maybe I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200592\">be excited to go to New Zealand for a week and visit, but she had a tone about it which was like \u201cYou\u2019ll go there for a while and then write this paper and then apply for this scholarship. I will give you a ton of travel money.\u201d It was kind of like here, here, without any explanation or context. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200593\">was kind of like the museum fantasy, except that it didn\u2019t fit at all and maybe it was similar in that she wasn\u2019t getting how much I didn\u2019t want to leave. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562492\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I think maybe she plays into the larger-than-life visions you can have of yourself, which are very exciting and which also tend to ignore the part of you that gets into that, at times, also to ignore the more sad stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yes. It feels like the larger-than-life vision maker is sleeping or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: So I know what you mean; I don\u2019t actually feel, in the moment, that that\u2019s . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: It feels like maybe you felt it a little bit with the museum job, but not with the Africa one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: Not really with the museum job either. It felt like a sort of far-away thing that would allow me plenty of time to leave all the people I need to leave. But maybe that is a larger-than-life way of looking at it, the idea that there will be this compact time of leaving people that I need to leave <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">and then it will be time to move.  (pause) What I really want to do is teach in the Fall. There is this super perfect course and the whole idea of staying more than six months in the lab feels really nice and sort of I can fellow into it if there is a teaching opportunity.  But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200652\">a good idea to bring it up with her right now. The teaching is [super based] (ph?) in time. Jeremy told her that I have a gift for teaching. It was sometime towards the end of last summer. Kelly pulled me into her office and said, \u201cJeremy said this really wonderful thing about you and you seem to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200653\">very good at this and if you are as good at it as you said, you should really nurture it.\u201d  In her mind that meant weaving my research in such a way that it would be appropriate to eventually do undergraduate, like a safety level three pathogen or using mice or monkeys or something that costs a ton <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200654\">of money. She has this sense, in a way, but then she also kind of has this weird way of not \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think she would go for it. I think she would be like \u201cthat\u2019s going to slow you down,\u201d which I think is true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s probably also not the only consideration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: No. I mean, it\u2019s a life. It\u2019s not a race, but then I am like it kind of feels like it\u2019s time to move on, so maybe I can teach in the next thing that I do. It\u2019s confusing. They have this committee meeting at the beginning of April and I have this feeling like it\u2019s going to help me a lot psychologically. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\"> Whether it goes well or it doesn\u2019t go well, there will be some sense of a timeframe from other people who aren\u2019t Kelly. (long pause)  Monday I went to the gym really late. I was sort of bothered by my anxiety about separating from you, that I sort of was hesitant with her and that I was vocal about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200692\">it and that the anxiety was there at all. I went to the gym really late, like at 9:30. I was so tired from something, the MS diagnosis and my dad\u2019s phone call over the weekend, were both on my mind a lot. It just feels like a lot of big stuff.  I dreamt about you Monday night and you e-mailed me on <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200693\">Monday night. Before the dream I had, for the first time, a pretty intense insomnia, like the anxiety coming. I have a lot of nights where I\u2019ll wake up and be wide awake. I can sort of soothe myself to sleep and it\u2019s not hard, but Monday was like it\u2019s time to take a spin and everything that really feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200694\">bad, one after another, over and over and over again. I was so sleepy it was hard to . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562492\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Kind of an anxiety parade?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. It was like this is why you\u2019re supposed to be asleep during this kind of stuff because it\u2019s too much. I felt like my brain was sort of healing from the day and I was supposed to be asleep for it, but I was awake. Sometimes that\u2019s how I feel. I haven\u2019t been able to give it all the space <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D1\">it really needs to take up because it feels pretty huge.  In the dream, I was trying to pack up \u2013 it was some other office, not this one \u2013 with you. The lights were off in the office and you told me that you haven\u2019t been able to hug me because you have feelings for me. It was that or like you will have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D2\">feelings for me if you hug me.  We were standing up and the door was cracked open and it was sort of like this transition thing and this is what you were telling me. In the dream I was like, \u201cWell thanks for telling me that. It makes me feel really good.\u201d But when I woke up from it, it was so disorienting. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D3\">(pause) Why is this coming up? I\u2019m not ready to talk about it with you yet.  I guess I think whatever boundary around hugging exists, I think I have a fantasy that it\u2019s more complicated than you\u2019re going to tell me about or than the other boundaries are. (pause)  It was very seductive all day [and it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D4\">sort of very exciting in a cool way] (ph?) to be in the dream space and also being in reality space. (pause) It\u2019s something that has continued through the week and it\u2019s pretty unpalatable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I guess there is something in this dream like a dam breaking, like the dream seems to be, in a way, the dam breaks for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: Yes. Or like the toothpick marshmallow cream [breaks.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: Right. The flimsy, rickety dam made of marshmallow. Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: You started shivering. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: I was thinking, among other things, when you were talking about walking home with Kelly, a fantasy of walking home with me and you\u2019re talking about me and my family and my stuff and you and Jeremy and your brother and your future and the fantasy I had about you.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: Yes. Then they stop. Kelly hugged me once. She said, \u201cAllison, I love you.\u201d She hugged me twice. That was one time. The other time was after (inaudible at 00:51:50). (pause) It seems like you should be able to, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I see. (pause) I am aware that that is something that would make a very big difference to you. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t want to talk about it to you. (crying)  [It\u2019s just a dream. (pause) I\u2019ll talk about it with you when I\u2019m over it.] (ph?) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I guess, in a way, it makes it even harder to talk with me. Maybe it\u2019s been harder feeling that way and talking to me about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: That I wasn\u2019t supposed to talk about it with you yet, that I feel that way about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562492\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">THERAPIST: There is so much going on with you right now and it may be an attempt (inaudible at 00:54:03) to talk to me or .  (pause) Maybe you\u2019re worried partly that I won\u2019t get how important this is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">CLIENT: Well I think you get it now. I think I\u2019m not worried about that. I think I\u2019m worried that (sighs) you won\u2019t get that I get how complex it is to hug each other and sort of how fraught it might be at certain points, like that I don\u2019t get that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">THERAPIST: I see \u2013 that you\u2019ll just be trying to trample the marshmallow-toothpick structure come hell or high water or whatever and that I won\u2019t understand that you appreciate the complexities there. I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause)  I felt like if I could have waited on it until I was ready to let go of it, give up on it, that that would be the right time to talk about it because then maybe it would be the right time to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I see. (long pause)  Why would I be less willing to do that when it really mattered or was really intense? That\u2019s when it\u2019s more fraught, is that the idea?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. I guess I haven\u2019t visited that fantasy \u2013 that you were trying to teach me a lesson? That\u2019s like the really cruel version. I think there is a lot going on right now.  (pause) You might feel it\u2019s wise to sort of see it and learn from it, like all of the stuff that comes up around a hug.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">THERAPIST: I see. Like I\u2019m kind of adhering to the abstinence more, where you sort of don\u2019t react or don\u2019t do something because that brings into relief what it\u2019s about or the feelings and meaning of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">THERAPIST: But like it\u2019s part of a therapeutic strategy of mine?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think that during the dream, because it was actually very accurate in terms of what I spend my time thinking about, which is maybe there is too much coming up around it for you. (pause) Like you\u2019re safer in this way, in your far-away chair. Sometimes it feels like you hide, like you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200951\">not able to hide. You\u2019re protected by the (inaudible at 00:59:56).  So if there is less intensity about it for me, then maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so threatening to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">THERAPIST: I see. And I wouldn\u2019t need to (inaudible at 01:00:17)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I certainly am clear that you are thinking about various possibilities of what could be. (pause) Another thing I imagine you\u2019re worried about with this is that you\u2019re worried I\u2019m going to see this as being about you wanting to drive the bus more than about our relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">CLIENT: Okay. Something that will change in me as we do more work, as we learn more.  Like it\u2019s more helpful to not do it because it\u2019s going to go away or it\u2019s going to change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all or I do think it\u2019s true for most of the things I want from you that I can\u2019t have. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I imagine most of those things you feel or know relate to something you\u2019re working on or working with or something like that; whereas, I think, this feels more about the closeness between you and me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly as it is, without striving to try and change anything. Yeah. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">THERAPIST: There is something about the importance or intensity about it that I think you imagine. And I think there are times I have or thought I have wanted to look away from.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562492\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A9\">CLIENT: Like the intensity is sort of a danger signal for you or a red flag.  Proceed with caution. Don\u2019t make any sudden moves. I think a lot of the intensity this week is a good example. I haven\u2019t cried so much in many months; it\u2019s like every night. It\u2019s a surprising number of tears, wailing horrible-ness. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A91\"> I was in this mode, which I think is good for my partner right now, because this is some super, super, intense intensity. Don\u2019t make any sudden moves, just kind of hold it. Hold her; hold it \u2013 and it passes. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve been so upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know either. Not yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">CLIENT: I\u2019m very uncomfortable in my lab because the paper is stalled and Jeremy, fucking Jeremy is always there. He works so much and, somehow, it\u2019s very problematic for me.  That\u2019s something that keeps coming up when I get upset this week. (sniffles) (pause) He is so focused. He doesn\u2019t have a super <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD1\">great relationship with his wife. We all think he\u2019s going to get divorced. It\u2019s horrible. And he\u2019s there like two hours before I get there and he\u2019s there two or three hours after I leave every single day and on the weekends. I don\u2019t have a break. There is no time where I can be in my space without him <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD2\">there and he\u2019s this binge guy \u2013 like he binge works and he binge drinks and he binge hunts and fishes and that\u2019s what he does.  And me, I\u2019m sort of unwinding every single day. There is kind of an involved yoga and meditation in the morning and there is a kind of involved maybe the same thing at night <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD3\">or maybe it\u2019s like one of the other eight things (chuckles) on the unwinding list. Something about him is casting a very, very sharp relief, the discomfort that I have around my own work, the sort of isolation I feel here, like not really being able to relate, how others will relate to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t understand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">CLIENT: Jeremy is working and he can talk about that and I\u2019m seeing you instead of working and I can\u2019t really talk about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not just that. I\u2019m also doing a ton of other stuff which I do talk about. I think I feel like I don\u2019t belong or like those aren\u2019t my people because they don\u2019t play jazz; they\u2019re not artists. There is a lot of feeling like I don\u2019t belong in the lab. It feels like a very surface trigger, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B51\">like I\u2019m easily triggered by it.  Tracy has all these issues with her kids. Everything is too much. I\u2019m getting sick of it.

I wrote Kelly about it today. (long pause)  When I think about [starting the lab paper] (ph?) in the next few months, it\u2019s not that complicated. I have my committee meeting. I had an opportunity to practice for it for a couple of weeks before next week. I have this paper <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B91\">I\u2019m chugging along on. I have the other lower-grade bad things, like the things I\u2019ve been maintaining for years; but somehow it all seems impossible, like I don\u2019t belong.  Whenever I make a little progress I get derailed by something, like a really intense emotional Jay dream. Then I have to wait two <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B92\">days until I can deal with (inaudible at 01:12:35). I do all this advocating. As part of my patient advocate role, I have been able to get Sasha and Bryan in touch with Nolan (sp?), the director. Nolan is the director of medicine and the director of member services of the health insurance.  That\u2019s lovely. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B93\">I told Tracy for the first time ever that I thought she and her family should get some help. I feel like I\u2019m advocating for Jeremy by keeping him (inaudible at 01:13:25). I haven\u2019t actually done it. I\u2019m advocating for my dad. My parents haven\u2019t been available. My dad is super preoccupied with his dad. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B94\">My mom has been on a distance trip. She goes once every two years on this glorious freedom trip.

It seemed like you got it earlier. I don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re (inaudible at 01:22:15) from it; but yes, it did.

(pause) I guess it felt partly like there was some stuff there, so it was not just a simple thing. It was probably going to take some time.  Also, it probably is a boundary thing. It\u2019s important, but it\u2019s not a critically urgent thing. It just seemed more like we should be talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E11\">it when you\u2019re here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">CLIENT: [I think God has created the plan for you to e-mail me because it meant that I didn\u2019t get to talk to you on the phone. It suggests to me pretty clear that it\u2019s a god-created thing, like what was important about it was that it was good, be different from other boundaries, not the content.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">THERAPIST: We should stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
