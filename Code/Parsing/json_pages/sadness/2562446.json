When I go to Cincinnati.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Let me write it down. There is also a week I will be out which may be the following one. I have to be out of town. So you are out next week, which must be -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: The 9th. It\u2019s quite likely the 16th. Is it the 23rd that you\u2019re gone? Let me see what I can do to try to come in on the 16th then. But defiantly the 9th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I was going to see if there another time that would be easier on the week of the 16th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Let me find out. It\u2019s possible that that Friday, the 18th, possibly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I actually leave in the afternoon on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: That\u2019s no big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: We\u2019ll figure it out. [1:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s been sort of one of those weeks with just stuff. The \u2013 I guess I could start with this. Did I mention to you that as much as I had been hoping never to accidentally run into Mike\u2019s mother again, that she\u2019s moving back to Miami?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. In fact, she may be there already. She fucked it up first. We\u2019re not going to do anything to get (inaudible at 2:11) at all, but feeling we just tend to do dumbass shit when we\u2019re going to do something and then, surprise, this person\u2019s here, too. So it\u2019s this kind of bullshit. That\u2019s partly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">why this memorial needed to be done when It did, because she was moving back to Miami. [2:35] So that went on this weekend. We weren\u2019t there. And there were a couple of other deaths over the weekend. So, oh, fuck. My mom\u2019s brother \u2013 my uncle actually, but, you know, passed from diabetes complications. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">It\u2019s very frustrating to me, mostly because getting right information of my mother is almost impossible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">I mostly just wanted to know \u2013 well, at the time this is happening, I\u2019m kind of being grilled by this fertility doctor about diabetes in my family. They\u2019re kind of horrified that he died from diabetes related complicated. Related stuff. My mom is like, why does it even really matter? We don\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">know. I\u2019m like, somebody knows. Was he awake? Was he asleep? She\u2019s very vague about this. I know that there was some sort of stroke that happened a couple of weeks ago, but they don\u2019t really \u2013 It\u2019s very frustrating. Mostly, because in her mind it doesn\u2019t really matter. You know what I mean? And I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">trying to find out this information so I can give precise \u2013 and it\u2019s just really frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">I just don\u2019t want to antagonize her right now. She\u2019s already lost two siblings. And it\u2019s got to be stressful on her. She becomes very difficult to be around when she\u2019s on these periods of time right now. I don\u2019t know. She just becomes very difficult to be around. And so this being in Cincinnati next <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">week, I\u2019m a little worried. They did not want us to come into town this week for the funeral. Originally, when I talked to them earlier \u2013 As of Monday, there was no funeral. But by Tuesday there was one and there is one that\u2019s happening today. So I don\u2019t know. He was a bachelor. Didn\u2019t have any kids. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">There\u2019s a reason \u2013 he might not have wanted one. I don\u2019t know. [5:05] So it\u2019s been kind of frustrating with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not just that you weren\u2019t able to get to either of the memorials, but that you\u2019re kind of excluded.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562446\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: My mom was right about this. This was a last minute thing very specifically and we were already going to be in town. She\u2019s like \u2013 she wasn\u2019t want of those, we don\u2019t want to be included. She understood \u2013 and she was right that it would be almost impossible to get down there. It wasn\u2019t like, an <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">excluded one. This eon. My mom got a phone call on Tuesday finding out that her sisters had made a different change and decided that they wanted to do something. So she found out with like, 12 hours\u2019 notice for viewing the body. [6:01] It was more of a \u2013 in a large family, things are complicated, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">I know she\u2019s right. And we\u2019ll with them next week to try to spend some time with family. But, it\u2019 just like I said, it\u2019s just one of those things that\u2019s really frustrating. You know, especially because like I said, that happened on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">Saturday was Mike\u2019s grandfather\u2019s memorial. Also apparently, sometime on Saturday. And this is one of those things where it\u2019s kind of weird. It is in a way kind of weird. We were notified by text message that his dad\u2019s mom died. We met them a few times. And I do feel bad for them. I was trying very <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">hard not to get involved with it, because they\u2019re making very bad decisions on how to treat his cancer. So he had a type of leukemia that, if you give the dog steroids, the dog can act like it\u2019s feeling a lot better, but it actually \u2013 the steroids fuel the cancer. [7:21] So they did that. And it went really fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">And the dog was great. The thing of it is, is that I\u2019m not making any judgments, because I don\u2019t really know. And I have a lot of personal feelings about this kind of stuff. But you can\u2019t make these decisions yourself. But it\u2019s just one of those things that, there is a lot of sharing that, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">really wasn\u2019t helpful right now, especially given, you know, all the other things that were going on. It just seemed like one more thing to deal with. But that is what it is, I guess. But it\u2019s mostly just trying to keep focused. We have a lot of medical testing and things like that to go through for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">me with the \u2013 [8:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Fertility stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. Right now, she really wants to make sure that \u2013 she\u2019s like, basically, your drugs are being damaged. We\u2019re very near a window to get your pregnant. I\u2019m not having trouble \u2013 I\u2019ve always had trouble walking, but I am in extreme pain lately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Did they \u2013 because of changes they\u2019ve made?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I had to go off certain medications for months to be able to \u2013 One of the things that they give with methotrexate \u2013 it\u2019s also used for abortions in China. It\u2019s an anti-metabaloid. So it\u2019s pretty bad. And it\u2019s used for treating cancer, so they need to get all that entirely out of your system. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">And she\u2019s wanted to be as \u2013 she basically \u2013 and I was really worried, because I did some quick research on her and a lot of people mentioned she was very cold and they didn\u2019t feel she was very easy to talk to. [9:15] I thought she was fine talking to. Especially, she totally got it. I was telling her <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">in terms of this \u2013 I\u2019m an engineer. Whether or not turning my cycles is really helpful right now, and makes you feel uninvolved. There\u2019s this data point that makes you feel Iike I have \u2013 She was, I totally get this. This is great. That kind of thing. She really got that kind of attitude for this kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200353\">of stuff. I wasn\u2019t going to tell her this, but it just sort of came out which is, you know, one of the contributing factors to (inaudible 9:15) was infertility. Specifically, infertility and depression with that, and then also not top of it, the drugs that they give you for to stimulate your ovaries <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200354\">can make you very, very unbalanced.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562446\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">And I basically told her, I don\u2019t\u2019 want to get too excited about any of this. Because, you know, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a worry for me. But she was also like, they\u2019re also really isolated, or they were at the time. [10:20] They were on the very outskirts of Chicago and a lot of other things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">But I didn\u2019t expect to tell her that and I did. And she was surprised to hear that. She had never known that \u2013 she had never gotten a hint of that. She\u2019s been doing this since \u201881. She could understand why I didn\u2019t want to be like, okay, this is going to happen. But the one thing that really made me <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">respect her was when, you\u2019ve got a narrow window. We\u2019ve got to figure out how to get past that. It needs to happen in this window, otherwise. It\u2019s not even just your pain and suffering, but also the fact that we have to worry about the joint damage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know if this is any help to you, but I saw somebody a while ago with rheumatoid arthritis who was going through IVF and other things like that and who found the Center for Reproductive Immunology that they found helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Once you get pregnant, it is almost always, if you stay pregnant, you almost always go through remission. That is the good thing. This might be the same place. [11:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: No, this is actually, the person wasn\u2019t living here. This was in Arizona.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: I will look into that, then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s called the Medical Center, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: It\u2019s easy to remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Like I said, I have no idea if that\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019ll plan to take a look at it. This place seems pretty good, but I would definitely \u2013 and they seem to be very good about being okay with working with other people. For example, before we even go forward, I need to get evaluated for a whole bunch of things, one of which is that they need <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">to know if they need to make sure \u2013 she wants to make sure that I get cleared by a high-risk obstetrician and my rheumatologist to find out whether or not twins are okay. Because they can stop that from happening. It lowers your chances, but she\u2019s really worried about the strain on my joints amongst <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200472\">other things. [12:14] So the fact that she was like, you know, we need to figure this part out. She\u2019s very much aware that this has to happen fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: It seems like she\u2019s very proactive and very organized in her thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Very proactive. But also, she didn\u2019t do it in a way that made me think, you\u2019re getting too old. You know, I mean, yes, I am older, but she said a lot of places are like yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: So she\u2019s problem solving. Very comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: For instance, advanced maternal age, it was never brought up, which was very good. So that was really good. It\u2019s just a lot of invasive testing and a bunch of other stuff that they have to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: When does the fun start?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562446\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: It depends. One of the tests has to be done 30 days after my period starts, so it\u2019s one of the screwed up \u2013 things stop immediately for that kind of thing. Mike\u2019s started already having testing done any day now pretty much. So they\u2019re doing a lot of genetic testing, too. [13:19] They\u2019re aware <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">that I have problems. His stuff is completely a mystery. My stuff is still a little bit of a mystery in terms of people aren\u2019t always really up front talking. The thing is, for my thing, though, it more of a culture \u2013 It\u2019s not as culture as in, you don\u2019t talk about your problems. It was like, if you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200532\">died from a really bad strain of TB, the hospital was, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">It wasn\u2019t a matter of being in denial, it was a matter of, you only go to this place unless you absolutely have to. So, a little different. So she seems to be pretty proactive, which is really helpful. It is nice there. In general, it\u2019s a lot more proactive than any doctor\u2019s office that I\u2019ve ever been <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">to. First of all, when you call, they say they have 24-hour answering service. It\u2019s not like an answering service. [14:22] There\u2019s like, a nurse who answers the phone who\u2019s part of the practice. Because, some things really do have to happen at 3:00 in the morning. And not just like, someone who\u2019s \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200552\">the phone calls are routed to their house, they write down the messages and give them in the morning, which is kind of pretty amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Also though, because certain things have to happen on certain days, a lot of things are seven days a week practice. It happens that that day lands on a Sunday, they have to do it that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s really great. The fact that basically, each one of the doctors in this practice \u2013 it is one for the treatment center is entirely there for (inaudible at 15:07) or whatever it is. Something like that. Each person you call for scheduling. You don\u2019t call this massive group. There is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">a person you call. And that person schedules only for that doctor. So a lot of \u2013 and it could be, and a lot of it is, because a majority of the clients are paying a fortune. But also, the fact that so many things are timely in nature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: That makes sense. That must be really reassuring to be getting very good care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: So, just like I said, I just have to find out going forward, what\u2019d going to happen, that kind of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: How much is going off the medications that you\u2019ve gone off and going through all the testing going to affect things for you. Will it affect your work schedule?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know yet. At this point, the testing probably not, but I don\u2019t know. [16:15] We\u2019re going to find a way to make it work. I do know that going off the medication\u2019s been really \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I \u2013actually, I legitimately don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going off the medication or this is something <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">new that\u2019s happening. I\u2019ve always had problems with my hip. The area which is being influenced has expanded. I think that it\u2019s just because of the fact that I\u2019m in more pain and I\u2019m compensating for it. And I\u2019m pulling muscles a little bit higher up in my back now, I think. But, you know, I\u2019m in a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200652\">of pain. It\u2019s really hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">Again, I went to this \u2013 and I\u2019m not a super paranoid person. So it took me years actually, to get an electric blanket or an electric heating pad as opposed to a microwave one for lots of reasons, one of which is that for a long time the regulations would be that they couldn\u2019t get that [17:09] and they <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">were only allowed to run for 20 minutes and all that stuff. It just made it easier just to have something to put in the microwave. And then, this fall I decided to get one. And I\u2019ve always been slightly afraid of being electrocuted. I have no idea why. I think it\u2019s from something that was told to me <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200672\">in childhood. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562446\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">But it\u2019s not like it\u2019s like a super fear in my mind that\u2019s like I\u2019m afraid to use it. But as I\u2019ve started to get more and more problems neurologically, a lot of times you have the prickly feeling in your skin. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard about this. But when you get certain pins and needles feelings. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">And so I stopped using that heat pad again, because when I\u2019m trying to go to sleep, I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s pins and needles from the leg, but it\u2019s keeping me awake. And it doesn\u2019t help that I looked up the heating pad on Amazon. Some people did have problems with shorts and things like that. [18:01]. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200692\">I don\u2019t think it\u2019s irrational to feel that way when there are situations, not like rare, but usually because they\u2019re misused for things like that to happen. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">So I\u2019m trying not to do that when I\u2019m sleeping which is kind of a pain in the ass, \u2018because I just spent \u2013 to get one that is physical therapy grade, it is kind of expensive, it\u2019s about 75 bucks. But what am I going to do with \u2013 you know, going back and forth with this. But I\u2019m thing really hard to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B1\">do anything, if possible. It\u2019s made me sad that I\u2019ve gained a lot weight again. I am trying not to drink diet sodas, trying to drink water. All this other stuff. Trying not to eat junk food and eating all kinds of crap that we don\u2019t even like the taste of, especially if it\u2019s supposed to be better for <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B2\">you, and gaining weight. It\u2019s really frustrating and pissing me off. [19:01] I was talking to my mom. She was like, you don\u2019t sound so happy about eating anything. I\u2019m like, well, I\u2019ve got quinoa crackers that sounds a lot better than it really is. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: You get healthier even hearing about them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really not that great. And a part of it\u2019s also the fact that I need \u2013 having so many members of my family having so many severe problems. Basically, other health problems being highly exacerbated by diabetes. The doctor said to me, I\u2019m not super paranoid about it, but I definitely will <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">be careful for the future. I don\u2019t want to get like that. My grandma lost her leg and my Uncle Dave has been in the hospital. He\u2019s been opposed to being \u2013 he has not been in the hospital. The closest thing of not being in the hospital he has been in has been in rehabilitation facilities and more than <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F2\">two years, three years, maybe. Because he got an injury on his leg. [20:06] It\u2019s weird because I was expecting him to lose the leg, to be honest. But even in my brain he had never like \u2013 never had a leg. Because he had an infection with MRSA that never went away. They did their best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">And it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m sort of ramping up to being defensive with my mom. Although she thinks she\u2019s really healthy, she really isn\u2019t. She goes through these phases. She sort of \u2013 because she\u2019s so damn fucking intelligent, she decided that she could make decisions. She can get her own rationality in things better <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">than other people can. And some of these things are okay for you or better for you, or whatever. But usually, they\u2019re not. But she \u2013 I just don\u2019t want to deal with the food-pushing thing right now with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562446\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: I see. She\u2019ll push you to eat other things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. But right now I technically need to be 30 pounds lighter for them to want to do IVF on me. [21:05] There is some fudging. In fact, the woman that weighed me told me that if I accidentally \u2013 like if I wore heels one day and I accidentally forgot to take them off, because of my height that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200751\">would be okay. Because, I\u2019m 5 foot four and a half. And if I made it up to five foot five and a half, it would be the amount of weight I need to lose would be significantly less. She understands it. I have rheumatoid arthritis. I can exactly move a lot. (inaudible due to simultaneous dialogue at 21:40) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200752\">But it\u2019s just one of those things where that probably changes your metabolism. Not permanently, but it might as well be. It takes a very long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re saying that was one of the reasons you had gained weight in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: I\u2019m naturally very thin. Used to be, at least. But it\u2019s been so long now, I don\u2019t even think about it that way. But I do. But yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 But I\u2019m not trying to be like, you know, restricting my food or anything like that. I\u2019m just really trying hard to find some way to find things to eat that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">are not so bad for me, and it\u2019s tricky. It\u2019s really tricky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: You mean that are bad calorie wise, or healthier?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: In general. Both of them. It is hard to find things that are both. Because there are, you know, and this is one of the things. [22:36] If I decide to worry about my diabetes \u2013 I don\u2019t have diabetes \u2013 but getting diabetes, then I have to use like, especially because everyone drinks with artificial <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">sweeteners. Because there are at least some suggestions that, although they don\u2019t have calories, they do change your insulin regulation. Not like that people who wear tin foil hats, but there\u2019s vague \u2013 there\u2019s a little bit of suggestion for that in reality. I don\u2019t know. But that way I\u2019m just trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D2\">to when I can, not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">I\u2019m trying hard to just stay away from things like refined grains. You know, because it\u2019s supposed to be healthier for you. And quite frankly, there is some big evidence that it is helpful in terms of insulation. So maybe. It\u2019s not like celiac, but definitely there\u2019s some reasonable \u2013 it\u2019s complicated. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F1\">Mom can be very frustrating like that. I don\u2019t know. She goes through phases, as I said, of good and bd. [24:04] Her personality is changing a lot lately. It\u2019s weird. Both her and my father have become significantly more religious over the past couple of years. I don\u2019t know if I ever explained this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F2\">to you. At one point, my mother actually became religious on a dare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: I think I remember that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: Okay, so when Mike and I were getting married, my mom really didn\u2019t attend Catholic Church very much at all. She did all this other stuff or whatever. Basically, she was raised originally orthodox. But there wasn\u2019t much orthodox \u2013 Russian Orthodox in the US where she was. There is sort of a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200831\">cross-compatibility with Catholicism. They accept each other\u2019s sacraments, blah, blah. And she went to Catholic school, etcetera. Well, both of my parents did. Neither one of them attended mass much at all. I can think of maybe one time in my entire period of time I lived with them that my mom did it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200832\">and I think it was for my first communion. I just wanted to make sure I wore my dress or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562446\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">When Mike and I got married, somebody at the church, which is has been the family church there. Although these hadn\u2019t attended, made some sort of snarky comment about people who don\u2019t show up and who only have interest in this. And then she suddenly was like oh, really? Are we going to do this? I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200851\">only going to attend masses in Latin. And other things like this. And this is actually, a little bit like me, but she\u2019s a lot more like this. For a while she was attending and doing all this other stuff just to show someone that she could out do them if she felt like it. [25:44] And she went like that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200852\">for about 12 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">THERAPIST: Competitive church going?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. But it\u2019s not like my soul is safer. It\u2019s like, I know more about this than you do, and therefore I made a willful choice about being involved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I wasn\u2019t copping out, it was an informed decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">CLIENT: It was an informed decision and I can do this better than you can, even more so if I need to. And for a while they were sort of antagonizing her with this. Like, this a long-time to do this for a dare or whatever. At some point my dad basically said, stop bothering your mother. We\u2019re getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D1\">older. Just leave it alone. And I\u2019m like, okay. [26:24] At some point I stopped. I still occasionally give her a hard time about this. And then now, my mom has been doing this thing where \u2013 going to visit hospitals, people in the hospital. I\u2019m like, Mom, please don\u2019t do this. When I\u2019m in the hospital, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D2\">the last thing \u2013 I have been harassed by those people who want to give me sacraments and this and that. I do not need \u2013 although actually, I have been given last rites. They don\u2019t call it last rites anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">They call it anointing of the sick, and you have to have an illness that is very bad. But when my arthritis was really, really bad I was actually given this. People in the hospital, they\u2019re really aggressive and annoying and kind of like \u2013 I was like, don\u2019t be one of those people, Mom. Whatever. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F1\">anyway, fast forward to today. My mom does a lot of stuff now. I just don\u2019t believe she believes any of it. Thought I think she believes that she \u2013 The problem is that she knows enough of it \u2013 she\u2019s not like an uninformed unbeliever. [27:20] Like I said, she can \u2013 she\u2019s so intellectually involved in <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F2\">a lot of this stuff, that it\u2019s like, kind of a nobody can just me for this, whether or not I believe or I don\u2019t believe kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">It\u2019s been going on for a really freaking long time for a dare. This is a 16-year-old dare at this point and it\u2019s really, really annoying me. I\u2019ve done things on dares that have made me really angry. And I guess it\u2019s kind of a weird thing. Anyway, she\u2019s been vaguely relating to this. I don\u2019t know why <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200911\">it bothers me so much that she keeps up with this. There are things that she does that I think is really, really wonderful. When my Aunt Iris died, because my Aunt Iris had so many problems. I think I told you that. Although she had basically complications related to long-term opiate abuse and being <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200912\">diabetic \u2013 she lost all her teeth, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562446\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20093\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s an alcoholic as well, maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. She drank. This is like, at this point that was low on the list. It probably was pretty bad if it was the only thing. Anyways, one of the things \u2013 and she would disappear for long periods of time. [28:42] And therefore, we wouldn\u2019t know what she was doing. And we, you know, my mom, when <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200951\">she passed, she started doing this every month or every fortnight or something like that. She, at this point in church she \u2013 nearby where Iris had lived had Iris\u2019 meal \u2013 it\u2019s a dinner for the homeless or are not necessarily homeless, but are having problems of the thing that she liked the best. So my <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200952\">mom pays for this. I think that\u2019s really awesome that she does that at the church. So there are things that she does that are really, really wonderful. But to me, I get really cranky, because all this is \u2013 I can\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019ve got to step away from this, because it\u2019s too easy for me to get her all upset about <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200953\">it, too. That kind of stuff I think is great. I think it\u2019s wonderful. I think my mother though, on some level, does it to prove that she can do it and she can walk away from some of it any time she wants to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20097\">THERAPIST: MY impression is it feels like a little much at this point. [29:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20099\">CLIENT: But, you know, my dad is signed up for something on Tuesdays where he goes and spends an hour praying for family members. I asked him. I said, Dad, really? No, you don\u2019t understand. This is the one time I don\u2019t want clients calling me. For me, it\u2019s the one time that I get a chance to be alone <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200991\">with my thoughts and what I want. It\u2019s dedicated time. I was like, okay. That\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re different. That\u2019s different, you know? I think it\u2019s called adoration. The thing is, I was raised so like, not in this. I know more about other religions than I do about Catholicism, because my mom and dad were not <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200992\">involved in that church at all or had anything to do with it at all. So I know more about many other religions than the one that I was actually raised in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B\">I was never educated in that stuff. [30:46] You know, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s kind of weird to have this kind of thing happen. My dad, I kind of understand it. He\u2019s becoming more so just because he said, this period of time, he sees that this is a chance to see that the religion has a spiritual leader that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B1\">he agrees with and he feels as if \u2013 not just agrees with it, but can guide the whole community into a better world. So this is a time to really be involved. He has more belief in it because of the corruption related stuff like that. I can get that. And then, there\u2019s the ongoing thing about getting my <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B2\">husband baptized. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever told you this. [31:33] We had this fight over whether or not Mike\u2019s been baptized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D\">We have no evidence whatsoever he\u2019s been baptized. His parent just sort of forgot. This doesn\u2019t surprise you at all. When it was time for us to get married, because in the Catholic Church, if you are trying to marry someone who isn\u2019t Catholic or hasn\u2019t been baptized anywhere at all at any religion. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D1\">You have to go through this disparity of cult form. This is hilarious, because \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562446\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Disparity of cult?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A1\">CLIENT: My husband, who is Jesuit educated, okay. But his parents just sort of forgot to baptize him. You know, they didn\u2019t go to church, so it didn\u2019t matter. But when we were getting married, we had to get his parents and a priest and his Catholic, you know, and his Jesuit church to get this form filled <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A11\">out so that we could get married. It was very weird. And it was really funny, because they were kind of arguing at the same time as his parents. I\u2019m pretty sure it was some kind of new-agey thing. Do you have any documentation anywhere? Anything? Any religion at all? Something? Nope. Okay, then we have <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A12\">to fill out these forms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A3\">Mike still knows more about Catholicism than I do or like, everybody does at all. [32:47] And my parents would really like to get him. My mother, actually. My dad, I don\u2019t think really cares. My dad\u2019s like yeah, he can say the mass as well as anybody else does. He can do it in French, Latin and English. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A31\">It\u2019s fine. You do it all the time in a Jesuit boy school thing. He knows it better than most people do. But the \u2013 it\u2019s just one of those things where they would really like him to be baptized. Mike\u2019s really resistant to the whole concept. I don\u2019t really understand why. It\u2019s actually really \u2013 it\u2019s that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A32\">his heart\u2019s been broken a couple of times. He at first wanted Mike to be the godparent, but he couldn\u2019t because he wasn\u2019t baptized. He still hasn\u2019t bothered doing it. [33:35] Because I don\u2019t really push him in one way or the other. I just think it\u2019s kind of weird that he\u2019s so resistant to this concept.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A5\">THERAPIST: I can imagine it would be nice for him to be a godparent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A7\">CLIENT: He is, more or less to his best friend\u2019s son who is now sixteen. But a couple of others kids too he is emotional, spiritual advising and raised a little bit more different. It\u2019s more \u2013 especially with Bernard, who\u2019s his best friend, Rowland\u2019s son, who also is at the same Jesuit school that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A71\">you \u2013 oh, yeah. They were here. Oh, my God. Bernard rode in the head the Charles. His friend from Miami came up here and they\u2019re going to do it next year, too. But it\u2019s more about like \u2013 less about what is the dogma indoctrinated and more about seeing, you know, being able to survive Jesuit school in <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A72\">your own terms and seeing what you take away from it, you know. Which he has been able to tell them about in terms of how to \u2013 what filters to apply to what you\u2019re getting from the school and what is appropriate for the real world. That kind of stuff, which is kind of awesome. But his school isn\u2019t as <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A73\">strict as it could be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A9\">There are much more from the philosophy of understanding and, you know, academia than necessarily anything from Portrait of the Artist. I was surprised. I went to a non-secular school. And therefore, the only experience I had was hearing from this was from Portrait of the Artist where the beat the children <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A91\">and starved them. [35:34] What, they don\u2019t have any corporal punishment at all? Really? That\u2019s what they tell us in secular school. But Mike loves his school so much that he would totally spend \u2013 because some people do come when they\u2019re doing a sabbatical of some sort. They come and teach for a year <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A92\">or a semester or whatever. He would totally do it. He loves that school. But it\u2019s such a weird thing, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562446\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AB\">Mom and I had a very \u2013 It\u2019s so weird with her. Like I said, it\u2019s so strange, because she is so educated and so able to work this to what she wants this to be that she can get other people to also do it. She\u2019s always had a real distortion when it came to things. She\u2019s real distortion when it came to <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200AB1\">things. She\u2019s really good at this. But we\u2019ll see. [36:58] I know that what I\u2019m feeling is not different from what most people when they go back to see their parents and they expect their parents to be static as they were when they were 18 and having them have life changes in people. I had a very strict <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200AB2\">upbringing and it didn\u2019t \u2013 In certain ways it bothered me. Some of it was being a challenge. Instead of being kicked out of the in the house I found ways around being able to get what I wanted anyways. I wasn\u2019t allowed to leave the house after a certain time period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AD\">So I just went around the rules and had them come into my house, you know. And as long as I kind of grazed around it they were pretty cool with it. Sort of. They liked to keep me thinking about how to obey the rules, but get what you want. It was very much like that. Now, Mom and Dad are so much more <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200AD1\">open-minded about things like that. No, no, no. You don\u2019t understand. This is not \u2013 The way the rules work, you don\u2019t get to do this, you just get to do this kind of thing. And it kind of gets me annoyed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AF\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 38:08)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B1\">CLIENT: About them getting less restrictive about things in terms of the rules of the house kind of thing, you know. For example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I get that in the past they would sort of set the rules, and you had to follow them. But they were kind of \u2013 they thought it was a good thing if you found ways to kind of get what you wanted within \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah. While still obeying the rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B7\">THERAPIST: What did it change to now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B9\">CLIENT: Now, a lot of rules don\u2019t exist for certain things, you know. I\u2019m trying to think of a good one for this, and I cannot. [38:37] Oh, here\u2019s a good one. Even when I was over 21, and I was nearby the house, if somebody who was a family member was there with their parents, they don\u2019t get to drink. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B91\">Their parents don\u2019t allow them to drink. Since it\u2019s their house, my dad is \u2013 both of them are \u2013 the people \u2013 they own this house, and they have liability for that. It doesn\u2019t matter. If the parents say so, you still don\u2019t get to do that. That is no so much anymore on that. That kind of \u2013 part of it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B92\">like I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m not really sure why it is that I\u2019m annoyed by that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BB\">Mostly, because of the fact that if it was \u2013 if they\u2019re worried about liability and this is their home then, why the hell they\u2019re not worried about it now. Or they just decided that it\u2019s easier to be, you know, when anyone gets in their home, it\u2019s easier to make friends than set down rules. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BB1\">know. But it\u2019s sort of, they\u2019ve always been so principled and so very specific about these are the things that absolutely can\u2019t budge, no matter what, that then changing on those principles it kind of bothers me. [39:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sort of wondering whether, in the back of your mind, you\u2019re also thinking of yourself as a parent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think of it \u2013 especially with my children now, I think that they would still obey my \u2013 Like, if I had any \u2013 Like, if my rules were stricter, for the most part, they\u2019re okay with that. Although with this dog here they break all kinds of rules or truly drive me crazy. They insist that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BF1\">they\u2019re not feeding her table scraps or doing this or that. And they totally do. It\u2019s like, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562446\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C1\">THERAPIST: The dog at their grandparents\u2019?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I don\u2019t think when it comes to things like alcohol. They\u2019d understand that I\u2019m like, no. It\u2019s weird, though. Because as much as they\u2019re like, no drinking in the house, if we were culturally in a place like France, it was like their house. It was total lawyer trap concept. Because it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C31\">my house, and therefore it\u2019s my property and I am liable, this is not acceptable. Whereas, if we were in a place that\u2019s like \u2013 where it was considered to be acceptable and legally acceptable to drink with parents, then that was a different story. Such a weird thing. Of course, you know, they\u2019re both <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C32\">attorneys, so they have a lot of, you know, logical confusion to that. [41:14] But there\u2019s just certain things that really \u2013 I\u2019m going to do my best not to drive my mother up the wall. I hope she does the same with me, too. So there are people I don\u2019t like her bringing up while I\u2019m around, because they <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C33\">are mean spirited and haven\u2019t changed their stripes, so I don\u2019t really want to hear about how great they are doing. I mean, she\u2019s pretty good about that so far. Once in a while she forgets. [42:06] At the end of the day, strong opinions are sort of \u2013 they\u2019re allowed, you know. Sometimes it\u2019s frustrating <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C34\">when I realize my mother has lost her strong opinion on certain things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah you have to deal with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C7\">CLIENT: And it isn\u2019t even just like, I realize I was wrong on something. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s more about denying that that wasn\u2019t really happening in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C9\">THERAPIST: When do you go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CB\">CLIENT: A week from today, probably. Depending upon the schedule and stuff. Mostly, Mike\u2019s experiments. Either a week from today or early Thursday, depending.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CD\">THERAPIST: We should stop for now.
