So I ended up taking the bus home. But in terms of like, things that I do need. I think it\u2019s probably low on brake fluid, although I checked it and seemed like it\u2019s probably fine. You know, I made it around the block, but I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">think it was a good idea to drive the thing. I think that they\u2019re over there now trying to fix it. [1:00] I\u2019ve had sort of a rough afternoon so far. So just to warn you. It feels like there\u2019s no room for me to be sad, or for me to not be able to sort of keep up my end of things. (pause) Like, yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">[2:02] (pause) I have a thing that\u2019s downtown doing Greek and then left for what turned out to be lunch with Camilla. [3:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">Then I came back and James was already gone and I planned to come back and go with him to take care of the car, but I ended up calling him, because I spent more time with Camilla than I expected. It was after 2:00, so if he was going to go, so there was not going to be enough time. But yeah, I\u2019m sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">of glad it worked out like that, even though I feel guilty. I think James would have preferred me to go with him, but I\u2019m not sure I would have. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s two people\u2019s worth of stuff to do. And I think he mainly wanted me to show him how to get there. But it isn\u2019t hard. You get on the bus <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">and then you get off the bus, and that\u2019s it. [4:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Are you waiting on pins and needles for him to blow up at you about the car?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Sort of. Even though I know that he\u2019s not going to or know that he shouldn\u2019t. But I feel like it\u2019s on me to fix or like, it\u2019s my fault that it\u2019s wrong. But things are wrong anyway. But I don\u2019t know how to fix it. [5:00] Yeah. I feel like he\u2019s going to blow up at me for leaving him in the lurch. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">But I really needed to not be dealing with car problems again. (pause) So I just came home and cried a lot and lay down for a while. (pause) [6:02] I ended up going to lunch with Camilla, which we can\u2019t really afford. But for whatever reason, I did. I\u2019m really not comfortable saying, thanks for taking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">this time to meet and chat with me, and I\u2019m glad that we can do this, but I can\u2019t afford to eat out ever. I don\u2019t have anything. (pause) [7:00] I think I\u2019m starting to feel at the end of my rope. It was tough to get through yesterday, even before the brakes were gone. Then, I was like, really? This <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">is what\u2019s going to happen now? It\u2019s like, okay, well\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">I had to figure out how to submit the thing online so that they wouldn\u2019t ticket the car for being out overnight in Arlington. Which, I know that it\u2019s not like, I\u2019m sure they would not have been ticketed. I really doubt it\u2019s that big of a deal. [8:02] Kim (sp) says that they leave their car out a lot, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">but that makes me feel better. I was like, doing that and I couldn\u2019t \u2013 Kim was working late, so Jay had to be with the kids. I couldn\u2019t like, ask for a ride down to the T, so I had to wait for the bus which, I don\u2019t know if you were out at all last night, but it was like, very, very cold and I was not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">dressed for it at all. I didn\u2019t have a hat (inaudible at 8:46). [9:02] Oh, shit. I had a check for you for January, and I forgot it, because I didn\u2019t bring my wallet. Sorry. I\u2019ll bring it on Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562448\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">THERAPIST: Oh, that reminds me. I have some scheduling stuff. Not this Monday, but the following two Mondays, I guess the 24th and 31st, maybe. I was wondering if you could meet at 5:15 on those days instead of 12:45.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. That would actually be better for me. Can I ask you to send me an e-mail or a text or something like that, so I can write it down. [10:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I will send you a text right now. I will also remind you. [11:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: You warned me about not \u2013 Blue Cross is not really is being slow. So we haven\u2019t gotten reimbursed for February.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: They have paid you for January, though? Oh, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: I think so, yeah. It sounds like that was unexpected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible at 12:06) I\u2019m glad they paid you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Anyway, we can pay you for January. [12:26] (pause) I had a very vivid dream about Dan (ph) two nights ago. He\u2019s sort of been in my mind the last couple of days. [13:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: You miss him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: (pause) (crying) Everything just hurts to talk about. (pause) [14:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: You seem certainly overburdened financially. And I guess in a way, maybe with James as well where you are feeling where you don\u2019t have much leeway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: (crying) Yeah. You know, and it\u2019s like we\u2019re making it. Like, we\u2019re talking about things and staying close to each other. It just hurts \u2013 hard. [15:42] (pause) The last couple of days particularly with stuff with the car, I feel like having to sort out or trying to sort out what of this sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">of fear and anxiety, what\u2019s coming from me and what\u2019s coming from James. Trying to figure out what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not is just this enormous thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: I would imagine it feels both crucial and like something you don\u2019t really have the energy to do. [16:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. I feel like, sort of in my conversations with other people, and it feels like, partially part of what you were saying. I\u2019m trying to find my way to not run into those things that just hurt so much. And I\u2019m not very good at it. [17:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I suspect it might be worse, in that here anyway, and maybe with some other people as well. It\u2019s a least there\u2019s a bit of way that in which you do also want to also want to mention them. I said worse in sort of like a tongue in cheek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: No, I mean, it feels worse. [18:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: But I am clear that what sure as hell feels easier, or would feel easier would just be to stay the hell away from this stuff that you\u2019re (inaudible at 19:02)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: But you know like, some sessions I do. And then I leave, and that hurts. Then I just feel bad. Not like, guilty, but just like, more burdened. Yeah. I want to talk about (inaudible at 19:26), but I \u2013 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really hard. [19:48] I thought I said this recently, but so much it seems to me, of what comes up around what you talk about recently is grief. And it feels like that\u2019s what\u2019s going on, I mean, as opposed to sort of sadness or frustration or uncertainty. I mean, those are around some, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">but grief seems to me to be the main thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [20:50] (crying) So I\u2019m thinking about like, where I try to go in my career. Do I try to teach? Do I try to be a priest? Do I do this? You know, it\u2019s sort of been important to me to say like, I don\u2019t want to be a priest, because I want to be back in grad school when I get home. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">[21:47] That\u2019s not what I want. That\u2019s not why I want that job. And at the same time, I miss that so much. And I have to deal with that. I have to not pretend that I\u2019m there. (pause) [22:43] It was hard talking with Camilla, \u2018cause she gets excited about ideas in the same way that I do. And in the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">way that\u2019s like, that\u2019s why I went to grad school. Like, be with people like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562448\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">I really like talking to her. And then I leave and I feel like I\u2019m punched in the stomach. (pause) [24:00] Working with this kids it\u2019s like, why do I do it. You know, I just love these kids. Sharon has started to get pretty upset when I leave at the end of the day. You know, she doesn\u2019t mind if she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">with her mom much. But she keeps saying, Tanya, Tanya like, as I\u2019m leaving. (pause) [25:04] It doesn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s going to end well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re worried you\u2019re really going to hurt them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: They\u2019re not my kids. (crying) And that\u2019s some of the \u2013 I wasn\u2019t really expecting that. {26:04] You know, if I left now, I really doubt that Sharon would remember me in five years. And I\u2019m not so worried that I\u2019m going to hurt them, because they don\u2019t need me in the same way. (crying) [27:16] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">(pause) I do have to like, for my own sanity, I need to find a new job. I need to be doing something more than this. I\u2019m too bored. I don\u2019t know how to deal with all of it. [28:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Do you think it would break your heart to leave them and at the same time, this is not what you want to be doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know whether this will help much, but my hunch is that you\u2019re kind of into something to do with grieving your mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: So I mean, it\u2019s a little bit self-explanatory, but I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not just talking about the (inaudible at 29:15) I guess, but kind of all of it. It seems to me there\u2019s some way at times like, your whole world, like, everywhere you look there\u2019s this kind of grief. With school and with Dan and with the difficult of things with James and with the kids <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">and with \u2013 well, that\u2019s a pretty good list. There\u2019s something that is so \u2013 I mean, in a lot of ways, those things make sense on their face. [30:17] You\u2019ve got the kids, you\u2019ve got work, school. And those are wonderful. But there\u2019s also this kind of very early quality to me, to it\u2019s overwhelming, it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">doesn\u2019t exactly come with many thoughts. I think oftentimes, it seems unending or it feels unending. It takes up the whole world. It\u2019s all the same in some way. You know, whether you feel it over here or over there. That all sounds like you\u2019re grieving your mom to me. I don\u2019t know from when or from <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F3\">what exactly. I mean, there\u2019s certainly plenty of her gone away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Several stages. [31:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: But you know, that\u2019s not something we\u2019re going to know probably for a while, I don\u2019t think. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: How will we know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Well, we might not. I mean, there are some things that happen very early that sort of, you kind of reconstruct, you know, and it seems very plausible and you never know. But there are other things where, eventually, you kind of feel it directly like, you\u2019re grieving about her rather than <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">any things. You know, I might not even try to sort of get there. But we\u2019ll sort of see where things go. I guess I mention it in that in a way, I guess I imagine it might help to think that there could be some \u2013 this could relate to something. 32:42}<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562448\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, it helps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: At the same time, I guess I don\u2019t mean to pretend that imagining this might be true, or entertaining it makes you feel less overwhelmed or does away with all of the kind of (inaudible at 33:13) and uncertainty that just seems part of it if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: It helps. [33:30] It helps to have some sort of \u2013 at least, some idea of \u2013 I guess I just feel like I am grieving and it feels like it\u2019s just totally out of proportion than with what actually happened. And it helps for there to be, at least, a possible reason for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It makes you feel less off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. [34:25] (pause) So I found that, being gone for two weeks, I think as far as I can tell, the only thing that I\u2019m sort of not replaceable for with kids is that like, her parents have no fucking clue what to do with Sharon\u2019s hair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">[Laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: I came back and it was like one, solid mat. [35:40] (pause) [36:27] It really bothers me that Dan\u2019s getting divorced, and it makes me really, really sad. And I\u2019m not sure why. I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s my fault. I don\u2019t feel responsible for it. It just sort of breaks my heart. [37:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: There must be part of it that feels torn apart for somebody that you care about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: It could be. (pause) I miss him. [38:29] (pause) My best friend from high school, Heather Kate is moving to Colorado in six months. Her husband got the job there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Will they live out there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t remember how far out it is, but it\u2019s not as far as New Mexico.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s true.
