(pause) [0:08:15]-[0:10:15] I have [mood spray\u2019s] (ph) shaken up. I don\u2019t know what to do about that. I pretty (skeptic) (ph). (pause) (inaudible at 0:11:03) (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: I imagine you feel kind of mixed or of two minds about whether I can like take care of you in some useful way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (chuckle) You know, my first thought was, \u201cYeah I\u2019m pretty sure that you can\u2019t.\u201d And my second thought was, \u201cWell why am I here?\u201d And so, yeah.

(pause) I think you\u2019re actually, you know, among other things, quite terrified that I\u2019m going to have an explanation for this, because in some way, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">would put some of it back on you, you think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Mm. (inaudible at 0:19:26] I mean I\u2019m definitely terrified that you will expect me to have an explanation. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I imagine also that I\u2019ll just expect you to do different or be different. (pause) [0:20:26]-[0:21:26] (pause) My sense is that when you said to me a minute ago, that it was \u2013 let me note that one down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Okay. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: That it was probably helpful to make it partly my problem too; that there was some relief in saying that, and I think also some horror probably?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, it feels like a pretty shitty thing to do, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: It seems to me, pretty close to what we were talking about yesterday? [0:22:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Can you remind me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Sure. Absolutely. You had come in really anxious about telling me you had been really upset by what we had talked about on Tuesday, especially my saying I thought I was wrong. You were I think really sort of worried that was going to make me feel horrible, and like I had been wrong, in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">way that I would sort of have some reaction to \u2013 a reaction that would like cause a sort of a breakdown between you and me, and our being able to kind of talk together about you. You remember that? [0:23:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, I remember that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah; true. (pause) And this doesn\u2019t seem that different to me, where you\u2019re (pause) I guess I am as in that way when you say something like, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s probably helpful to make this partly your problem.\u201d That there\u2019s a part of me that goes, \u201cOh my f****ing God.\u201d (chuckle) You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">like, that was a really shitty thing to say; I am horrible. And probably (imperiled) (ph) that that must have been a really shitty thing to hear. You know, talked you must be feeling completely horrible. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:24:57) (pause) (inaudible at 0:25:04) (pause) Anyway, I feel really bad about asking other people to carry this for me. I feel bad about asking you to (inaudible at 0:25:21). But, you know, I do it, but I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t know, I just feel like (pause) I necessarily mind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200651\">to carry him. I don\u2019t like having to say that I can\u2019t do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You know I think you were saying yesterday that you think like guilt and shame kind of go together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I think this is sort of ground zero.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [0:26:00]-[0:28:00] (pause) I think (renovating) (ph) it\u2019s not like work. It\u2019s like \u2013 yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah it\u2019s really terrible, because it\u2019s frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I\u2019m just trying to \u2013 yeah, trying to pull myself out of it, but I can\u2019t. (pause) [0:29:22] It sort of feels like sleeping on a bad mattress, and I keep turning and trying to find a place that will be more comfortable. And like, there\u2019s not place that is comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562254\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Right.

But I\u2019m concerned, because I think (pause) sort of explaining <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">to you what I think, will feel or may feel to you kind of both a bit retaliatory, and also alienating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">Because I think it seems; part of what seems helpful to you when you\u2019re feeling this bad, [I kind of wonderful helpful] (ph) is for me or someone else to like be at loose ends in the way that you are. Like that\u2019s part of what I think, not being in it at as much on your own feels like to you. [0:36:46] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: It helps maybe.

But sort of the (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Well, you know, the truth is, that is a chunk of an answer in my mind; it\u2019s like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Fix my problems; be better at (inaudible at 0:38:11)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: (chuckle) (pause) I think part of where you\u2019re stuck is that on one side, being terrified, guilty and ashamed of putting any of this on anyone else \u2013 I don\u2019t know (inaudible at 0:38:50). (pause) At the same time, I think, you\u2019re really quite desperate for he and I to carry some of it for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">you, which means, I think in part, to know a little something about what it\u2019s like. Not just as you could explain it, but as you could for example, show me (pause) in showing me that causes don\u2019t matter; explanations don\u2019t matter; that it wasn\u2019t happening yesterday doesn\u2019t matter; that nothing I say <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200852\">in the moment will make it better. [0:40:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">I mean I think if I didn\u2019t feel that way about it, you know, if I didn\u2019t have sense of that, I don\u2019t think it would feel like I really knew anything about what you were going through. But how could you want me to feel that, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [0:41:00] (pause) I don\u2019t know whether that helped.
