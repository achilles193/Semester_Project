So this class is supposed to be five weeks. I think after that I'll take time. I stayed up last night to prepare for it for tutoring today and then this morning had breakfast with Geoffrey and then had to tutor again and then I got lost on my way home and it's not (unclear). <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">It's just like 98 to 95 and it's like a 25-minute drive and it took me two hours to get home. Really, I'd never driven in Denver at all so I got like really lost. I was fine on the interstate and as soon as I got off of the bridge I got really, really lost. So yeah. And I also had to like go back and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">give her her book back.

It was like not very as we were walking back from the diner he started talking about languages and asked like, 'how do you keep the work up?' And I was like, 'oh I don't. It's gone.' And he was like, 'I bet you remember more of it than you think.' And I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">like, 'maybe, but I don't think so.' So you guys are planning to live in Denver for the next couple of years? He was like hitting all the high points. Well, we don't know.

It's like everything I think of to say I feel like I'm getting really defensive about what we have talked about the last couple of sessions and I try to derail the defensiveness with the result that I don't have anything to say. (Laughs) Which is not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">that helpful. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(Pause): [00:03:58 00:04:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I'm having a hard time like I want to say the right things and as a result I can't think of anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">(Pause): [00:04:16 00:04:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I want to tell you that I've had a tough day but then I worry about whether you'll see that rightly as me being defensive that I don't it's exhausting. Mostly because we've been talking about really hard things and I feel like if I say I've had a hard day today you'll read that as me saying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">'I don't want to talk about hard things today.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Ah. I see. (Unclear). Partly, because I guess there's also the implication there that I think you should be talking about hard things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I pretty much take that as a given which like probably the second or the third time that you've pointed that out in a situation like this and I don't ever think of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Like that is where (unclear) right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">(Pause): [00:05:38 00:05:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Well then, let me make a position statement and you can feel free to disbelieve.

(Laughs) Yeah. Well, maybe it's like I'm trying to do maybe like free-associating is so hard for me that I want to do anything other than that. (Laughs) I don't know. I feel like today, especially, is like I try to say something and I get so like get distracted <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">by like what would it mean if I said this to the point where I just can't say anything at all.

You know, if I can talk about what I want I'll talk about the day at the beach. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">It should be exciting. Which is sort of proverbially fun and light and easy but you go right to the scars and self-image. And sort of self-consciousness and being seen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I can't think about anything else. When I think about that trip.

In other words, you know, I think of lot of your worry is about what other people are going to think if they see you at the beach, either about how you look, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200791\">how you're shaped, or your scars. And I think that sort of spills over to other people who are more judgmental or critical. I mean people do make judgments.

They're like, 'we always tell you.' And I'm like, 'you really don't.' (Laughs) Part of it bothering me is like they're either like plotting something or they're preoccupied and whispering to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">each other when I'm just, 'eat your fucking food.' Like just a cup of food in you I just need you to eat something. But yeah, a lot of it is I don't like people talking about me. Like very, like it really bothers me. Somehow, I'm not exactly sure how this happened, but I found myself in the position <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200912\">of having to explain to them, like having to explain mental illness to them. It was like one of those my approach is like, answer questions that are asked, but don't elaborate. Like, answer them very simply and they get distracted and talk about something else. So they like they asked me why I came <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200913\">at 9 instead of 8 and I said I had a doctor's appointment. And they said, but you had a doctor's appointment last week. And I said I know I had a doctor's appointment last week, too. And I said I have a doctor's appointment every week and they said why is that? And I said well, before I came to see <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200914\">you guys I was sick for a long time so I go to the doctor so I won't be sick anymore. And (unclear proper name) says, \"I know what it is.

My mind was sick. And they're like, well that doesn't make any sense. And I said, well, I was sad a lot. And they're like and that was where they were kind of like what? I don't understand and then they got distracted and talked about something else. But it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">was like a very strange situation to be in. You know, their parents know I had ECT and things like that so like I don't feel it to be a shocker for them. And also I'm not that good about lying to children. I don't believe in it. But I also don't feel good about giving them more than they can deal with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">(Pause): [00:21:53 00:22:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: But like, 'you're not eating right.' That was my favorite. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I know (unclear) was like somebody must always be telling them they need to eat so that they can grow up healthy, big and strong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yes. And their dad is a doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: But no it's a that is like the main thing that their parents' (unclear). Jackson really likes rolls. Selena leaves all of the sugar everywhere. I really understand that. I can't blame her at all. And (unclear proper name) is very preoccupied with like only he says, no, we only get to eat <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">the snack that has sugar in it once a week like no, we're to going to eat both of these.
