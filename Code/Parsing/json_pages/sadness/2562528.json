[inaudible] Thanks for fitting me in. We have a\u2026 we had a meeting that we were able to schedule at the venue for the event in two weeks for our big conference. Our [inaudible] conference is in two weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Right, that\u2019s why\u2026 so a week from Friday and two weeks from today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: So because\u2026 yeah, because Friday we have the advisory committee and then the\u2026 Monday the 12th we have an all-day staff retreat to talk about how much we love the center and what we all can do to make it better and enjoy our lives there. And it\u2019s going to be with the director and executive director, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">who are not going to be there in a month. So I\u2019m like uh\u2026 so right, there\u2019s that. And then today we have the [inaudible] at four. [1:02] So the weekend was pretty good for me. I mean just relaxing. I had a\u2026 I went out to dinner with Stephanie on Friday and that was really nice. We went to this place <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">in Anaheim. It\u2019s new. It\u2019s in the Square, across the street from Star Market. And it\u2019s really good. I recommend it. But my Mom had gone there and I had read about it, and then I was just kind of like, I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s drive up the street. And I was like oh yeah, this place. But anyway, that was really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">nice. And then Saturday, oh, I got up really early and went and got an oil change and stuff for my car, and then I came home and napped and then my roommate was being really annoying. And I had been saying to Stephanie the night before, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. And she was like you have said <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200154\">four different things this week that you\u2019re going to do. You\u2019ve said still live with\u2026 no, you said say it the way it is, try to rent it\u2026 do it on your own, ask your dad for help to do it on your own, get a new roommate, move to a smaller apartment, or move to Houston. [2:34] And she was like but whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200155\">you do, whatever you do, she\u2019s like do not live with her again. She\u2019s like no matter how marginally\u2026 how\u2026 if it\u2019s marginally better right now, it\u2019s not good. And then almost as if I, when was it that\u2026 it was almost as if I needed a\u2026 almost on cue with me, oh, maybe I need a reminder that she\u2026 I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200156\">live with her, I think she came home really, really drunk on Saturday because I heard a lot of commotion up the stairs. And my room is right there, my door\u2019s right there. And I heard her friend Frank, who she had ahead of time\u2026 told me was going to sleep over, who\u2019s kind of cool; I feel bad for him. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200157\">I think he\u2019s a depressed guy, whatever. But it didn\u2019t really sound like he was drunk. It sounded like he was helping her up the stairs. And I didn\u2019t get up to look in the peephole soon enough so I didn\u2019t see, but I heard him like which key, and she\u2019s like oh, just one second, and retarded. And so it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200158\">was almost like okay, that\u2019s why I can\u2019t live with you. This is\u2026 your friend is carrying you home and crashing on our couch? We\u2019re 30. [3:49] So then Saturday night I didn\u2019t do anything. That was the night that she [inaudible] And then Sunday I got up and went to my Mom\u2019s house. And we were\u2026 first of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200159\">all, we were having some sort of a psychic connection or something because I had been thinking maybe since Reno or something, I don\u2019t even know, ooh, I want crepes. I want my Mom to make crepes. She makes crepes really well. And then I get there and she had made crepe batter. I was like\u2026 and I had said <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001510\">to her oh, let\u2019s have breakfast or something. You want to make breakfast. And then I hadn\u2019t specified anything. Then I was like whoa, did I tell you that I wanted crepes? She was like no. I was like whoa, you read my mind. And then we\u2026 I was talking to her about what to do and it\u2019s either that I get <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001511\">a new roommate\u2026 I\u2026 the conclusion was that I think I\u2019m going to move to Houston. Guess we\u2019re here again.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20014-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562528\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">CLIENT: Hm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">THERAPIST: I said guess we\u2019re here again. [5:21] But A) I don\u2019t know, what am I going to do, stay here, find another roommate? I don\u2019t know, I should just do it and see what happens, and then if it sucks I\u2019ll come back, whatever. But I\u2019m not getting any jobs at MIT, and unless I do it before September <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">then why resign my lease and go through the whole thing again of finding a new roommate and whatever when I could just move and do something I\u2019ve been talking about for ten years and see what it\u2019s like. And then if I don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t like it. And if I like it, great, then\u2026 and so my Mom is so <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200192\">supportive of this idea, and my friends are as well, that we are going to have a family meeting. And I already said we should have a family meeting because I just wanted people\u2019s input about what to do about the Helen situation, that I can\u2019t live with her anymore, again, and should I move, should I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200193\">do this, should I do that. But now it\u2019s like well this is what I want to do. So have a family meeting about it. And I\u2019m sure that Tracy and my Dad are just going to be like well good luck. So I\u2019m prepared for that. And so whatever, I\u2019ll try my best to do it on my own and see what happens. But I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200194\">think that it\u2019s worth it at this point to try that. [6:49] (pause) I just don\u2019t see myself excited to do anything here, and I am not\u2026 I\u2019m hardly even looking forward to the summer because then it\u2019s just going to be followed by\u2026 all I\u2019m thinking about is September and the leaves and roommate, and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200195\">it\u2019s going to be September again and I\u2019m going to be in the same job starting the same semester dealing with the same bullshit. And that thought really makes me sad. (pause) Well (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I just have the sense that you kind of want my input, like do I think this is a good idea or not. [10:04] And that [inaudible] feel like my response is a little bit like your Dad and Tracy\u2019s, like okay, well yeah, I guess that\u2019s nice, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Well, I\u2019m right. Obviously in a different way because I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect you to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: No, I know. I mean I guess the things\u2026 I mean there are two things. One is the way I feel is that maybe a more visceral level and sort of how you know in your head that I\u2019m likely to respond. I mean I know you know in your head that I\u2019m not going to\u2026 well, here\u2019s what I think are the good <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">points and bad points about that plan, blah, blah, blah. At the same time [inaudible] a little bit like and now Ethan, over to you. And over to you. Okay, [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: I think a little, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Well the thing is, I don\u2019t really\u2026 I mean I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s a good idea. [11:13] So\u2026 and Stephanie was saying her main concern is if I\u2019m going to\u2026 that I might feel lonely. And so she\u2019s just concerned about the whole thing overall with my mental health. She\u2019s concerned about\u2026 and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">I was texting with Sergio and\u2026 about it and he said something that for some reason\u2026 and I was trying to think why did this rub me the wrong way. I was just kind of saying\u2026 because I was saying something about oh, it\u2019s cheaper to buy than to rent down there, or something like that because he\u2019s in real <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">estate and whatever. And he responded some way about oh, blah, blah, blah, you don\u2019t have to live in it necessarily. Something blah, blah, blah. I\u2019ll talk to you later; I can\u2019t talk. And I said something, I was like well, either way, I\u2019m betting all my chips or whatever on this endeavor. And he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">like\u2026 and I had said before I regret not doing it, this and that, may as well, blah, blah, blah. He was like I hear you. I don\u2019t know why this made me so irritated. I hear you. Everyone needs goals. I don\u2019t know why it really irritated me. I was like everyone needs goals? What the fuck are you talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200254\">about you asshole? That was how I talked in my head. [12:44] Fuck you. Like you have some fucking goals. I don\u2019t even know. Well because it doesn\u2019t even feel like a goal. Or I don\u2019t know, it seemed\u2026 that response seemed very\u2026 I don\u2019t know what the word is. I don\u2019t know how to pinpoint it but it really, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200255\">really rubbed me the wrong way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562528\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: Well I guess that\u2019s part of it but probably [inaudible] it seems like quite a distant response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: Exactly, distant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Like he\u2019s sort of stepping outside of the relationship between you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: Right, that is part of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure it feels patronizing as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Like oh, well, yeah, sure. Whatever you say idiot, or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: I see. Oh, so it seemed insulting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, like everyone needs goals. As if this is an idiotic goal. You know what I mean? Or it seemed like yeah, like is this somebody where oh, I\u2019m trying to quit smoking within the next ten years. Oh, everyone needs a goal. Or something like that. Or like oh, I\u2019m trying to hit the lottery in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">the next six months. Well everyone needs goals. Or something like that. [14:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah, maybe it\u2019s a little bit like I don\u2019t really want to deal with this and I don\u2019t want to deal with you, so I\u2019m going to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: And this is stupid. I don\u2019t care about this conversation or your idiot little goal of moving to Houston and spending all your money and [inaudible] on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] Like it\u2019s a real cop out, of a response I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, well, and it\u2019s almost like\u2026 which just proves it\u2019s a completely superficial way that he wants to be in my life. It just is an example of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Which [inaudible] it reminds me of your Dad and Tracy\u2019s response in your mind. I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Oh, they\u2019re the\u2026 going to be completely at arm\u2019s length. Good luck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I hope it works out for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: I hope it works out for you, exactly. We\u2019ll be excited to come visit you once you get settled in kind of thing. [15:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: But not in the kind of nitty gritty of what this is about for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: What the risks are, why you\u2019re doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: I think they\u2019re going to have, it feels like, a similar response in oh, you idiot. This sounds stupid. Good luck. (pause) Every time I feel like Julie\u2026 they\u2019re judging my decisions or how I spend my time or money or whatever. Every time I feel that\u2026 every time I\u2026 all I can feel, all I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">saying, is\u2026 or I could just give it another few years and meet somebody 20 years older than me with kids already and then just marry him and then be miserable the rest of my life. Could do that. That\u2019s what I always feel like.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562528\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Which would be her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Yes. [16:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s miserable? I didn\u2019t know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: I have no idea, maybe not. (overlapping talk) No, she may not be because then my mom and I were also discussing, yesterday, how, really, my father, just like whatever his wife says he just goes along with. She\u2019s like\u2026 because she\u2019s thinking back to how he was with her and how he is with her. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">And she\u2019s like oh my God, he just goes along with whatever I said. She\u2019s like because why did I think he was someone normal and whatever when I was married to him and now he\u2019s just a complete freak. Then she said oh my God, because he just did whatever I said, for the most part. And he does that with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200552\">Tracy too. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: So (pause) I guess it seems to me like whatever happens, whatever you decide to do, that thinking about the move sort of creates a referendum for the people around you, and it seems it\u2019s kind of helping you feel clear about who\u2019s with you and who\u2019s not. [19:59] And not new information exactly, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">but the way your Mom is supportive and I guess sounds interested and was right in sync about the crepes anyway. And Stephanie is, well, who kind of heard closely what you said and remembered it better, in a way, than you did. Then\u2026 and then there\u2019s Sergio and your Dad on the other side, and I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200572\">me, for a minute anyway, on the other side, not really saying anything about it. And (pause) I get that (pause) [inaudible] right, but a part of what\u2026 why you want to leave is for not feeling like either Dad or that guy that you\u2019re involved with is kind of like really with you. [22:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s part of why I want to leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I think there are a lot of other things, but those things are what are coming up today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: I mean yes, and also it has to do with still my [inaudible] you and just having spent the last almost two years just kind of trying to figure out my place here outside of that relationship now, and not really feeling like I\u2019m getting anywhere. And just kind of wanting to change scenery for the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">sake of that and\u2026 just because I never have. And rather than wait around, yeah, rather than wait around for probably you or Sergio or my Dad or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Or I think, honestly, neither really help you fix it in some way that\u2019s feeling like it\u2019s fixing it. [23:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Yes. But aside from that I also don\u2019t even feel a desire to get involved in any of the things that I know could also help me fix it in partnership with therapy with you here. I\u2019m not finding myself oh, let me start doing all these activities here or, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just not very motivated <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">by anything. But I think that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re pretty disappointed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s not a direct\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: \u2026feeling often overtrying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019m not saying all you need to do is just keep your chin up and get out there, I\u2019m just saying I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re at.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562528\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well like I said, I think that it\u2019s just a lot of feeling like just the idea of starting again and not\u2026 and just having a real short summer. I\u2019m not even excited for summer. It\u2019s just a really short summer, and then another semester of events and new director and open\u2026 I just can\u2019t even\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">and roommate. And every time I walk by the fucking apartment I think of heroin addicts, or him. [24:41] So I think I just need to try this. And I think it\u2019s really financially irresponsible of me, the most, because I may have to take out my entire retirement in cash because that\u2019s all my money. Plus <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200712\">acquire more debt. But I almost feel like it\u2019s worth it. And my Mom kind of does too. She\u2019s like\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t have this retirement savings when I was 30. You can start over. Kind of like you\u2019re only 30. (pause) I mean anxiety is forming even just saying that out loud about oh, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200713\">only money. It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m only 30. But really, what if it changes my life, or not and I want to come home. But either way I feel that it\u2019s worth it to me right now. I don\u2019t know. [26:18] I mean you\u2019re as\u2026 if you were my financial advisor at this point you\u2019d be saying absolutely this is really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200714\">not... an unwise choice. Luckily I don\u2019t have a financial advisor. (laughter) And also, I mean another part of\u2026 seeing Mindy in Reno, she\u2019s so happy and she\u2019s making new friends and enjoying the new city, and enjoying different weather and just really seems herself. And I don\u2019t know, I was like huh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200715\">okay, me too. She doesn\u2019t know where she\u2019s going next. She doesn\u2019t know how long she\u2019s going to stay there. She has a boyfriend that she likes a lot. Why not me? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: So I guess it does seem to me that there are kind of two sides. [28:06] One is wanting to get away from this particular kind of disappointment that we talked about, which is the sort of disappointment that also feels very shaming, where\u2026 with your roommate. You\u2019re disappointed in her but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">it\u2019s also in this way that I think kind of makes you feel like a loser for living with her, or for living above this\u2026 that heroin addict. But that\u2019s not the only thing. You\u2019re saying now there\u2019s also a way that there\u2019s a sense of your hope and possibility and just [inaudible] something better. It seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200732\">that is also part of why you want to move. In other words, not just running from something but you also sound like you have some sort of [inaudible] or something better and could find it, is a part of it as well. (pause) Maybe it\u2019s also that you\u2019re it sounds so obvious, but I think in a way maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200733\">it isn\u2019t very sad about having something here over the last couple of years in a way that I think might be hard for you to bear. [31:08] In other words, you haven\u2019t had a lot of what you wanted with work and with relationships. Things haven\u2019t gone that way [inaudible] haven\u2019t gone your way in that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200734\">regard. And, I don\u2019t know, I guess it [inaudible] kind of disappointed and feeling bad about yourself, plus just something that feels sad that life has not turned out over the last few years how you wanted. (pause) [inaudible] hard to be in touch with.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562528\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it\u2019s just very repetitive. [32:30] Things here have felt very repetitive. So I think it\u2019s worth trying something else. I was talking to Nora last night for a little while in text. I haven\u2019t talked to her in a while. But I was just in touch with her because I\u2019m going to go to Chicago <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200751\">next weekend so\u2026 I mean this weekend. So and I was telling her I think this is what I\u2019m going to do, finally, and that\u2026 especially because of a couple things that happened this month. Life\u2019s too short and I don\u2019t want to regret things, and I just need a change of scenery, whatever. And I told her what <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200752\">happened. She said oh my God\u2026 about Nathan and then about Stephanie\u2019s father in law. And then she\u2019s like oh my God, she\u2019s like oh my God, that\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m so sorry to hear it. And she\u2019s like yeah, time to go to Houston. Her reaction was almost like yeah, time for a change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: I see, like get out of Dodge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Just go. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m feeling about it too. And I understand the concern. I mean yes, wherever you go there you are, right? [33:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Pretty sure you\u2019re right about that, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: But okay (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Something else is occurring to me that I\u2019m surprised\u2026 you know when I said [inaudible] before [inaudible] crossed your mind, that hadn\u2019t crossed my mind until just now, which is the downstairs neighbor dying, especially having been from Anaheim, right, and your brother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: Oh my God, of course. Yeah, and one of the things that my Mom talked about a lot was that she was like oh my God, that could\u2019ve been Michael. What if he had been living with you and then they had met and then used together and whatever. And then that started\u2026 then she was like well, we\u2019re so <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200811\">lucky that Michael didn\u2019t get to that point and thank God, and oh my God this and that. [35:08] So yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: Again, I\u2019m thinking about it (pause) from the point of view also of (pause) the kind of guy who\u2019s always been and been very important in your life, who has been a terrible disappointment in a way that also feels kind of shaming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: Well yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: This may sound a bit off the wall, but it seems right to me. I bet there\u2019s some important way that I feel to you like him. I know that in a\u2026 to Michael. [39:17] I would imagine that in a lot of ways I seem not very much like him at all, but I don\u2019t know, I guess I imagine for you, on some <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">kind of intuitive and not very fitted [ph?] with certain realities kind of level I don\u2019t mean like dripping [ph?] crazy, I just mean it\u2019s like a transfer of words, but you\u2019re kind of waiting for me to get my butt in gear and do something to make things better for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: And the way that I\u2019m not doing that makes me seem like him. Again, I know in your head you know that I\u2019m not going to say okay, so you know what, tomorrow come over and we\u2019re going to square this all away. I\u2019m going to help find you a job and do this and that and the other thing just to make <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B1\">everything better. Give you the answers so you\u2019ll have those and\u2026 I know. But in some other way I bet it feels like I\u2019m kind of dicking around and not really fixing things. [40:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: More like the therapy is\u2026 should get [inaudible] or something. Well in that sense are you taking it as an insult that I want to move, like oh, the therapy isn\u2019t working, maybe Houston will?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562528\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m taking it as a something of a very familiar, often repeated experience for you of having a guy who\u2019s really supposed to be there for you, who you\u2019ve invested a lot in, and who isn\u2019t\u2026 turns out not to be or promises or pretends to be and isn\u2019t. [41:52] I guess what I\u2019m focused on is the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F1\">sort of aspect of your experience with this, which is like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">THERAPIST: Which I guess, in a way, it\u2019s hard to say this without sounding defensive, and perhaps I\u2019m being, but I think it\u2019s also a valid point. That is therapy in gear. And\u2026 do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t mean, of course, that you are experiencing this that way resolves on its own, fixes something for you, but I do mean that you being engaged here and bringing what\u2019s happened in your life here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">THERAPIST: In a way that we can look at and question and all of that.
