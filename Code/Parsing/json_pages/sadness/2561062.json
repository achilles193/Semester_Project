So I would like to continue our conversation from last week. I think we need to start somewhere else. So during couple's counseling Monday, I told I guess both of them, but I told Tanya that I was thinking about leaving her. So that seemed important to talk about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: What was it like to say that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Hard and terrifying afterwards. [Sort of] (ph) I've said this thing that I've avoided saying for weeks or months, so as not to hurt her. And clearly, it hurt her, and (pause) at the time, she said that she knew. Like, that that was not a surprise to her. She has since revised that to say that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">you know, that was more like her worst fear and was one of the many things she used to beat herself up about. (Pause) But that (pause) she felt shocked and betrayed. That was our conversation yesterday. We had (ph) couple's counseling on Monday. Monday night, she said she was scared about the future <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">of our relationship. I don't think I've ever felt closer to her than that moment in the last several weeks, because I actually felt like we were talking about the same relationship. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">[And since it all came out] (ph), I feel like the couple's counseling has been going well. You kind of kept asking about it, and I've kind of said, \"Well (ph), it's been fine.\" That's been about all I've said, but I felt like we've been (pause) dealing with reducing stress, individually and together, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">in the couple's counseling sessions, and that's been good, but in some sense, it's like it's been until (ph) things have felt better in the sort of immediate sense, but there's still this other big thing that just is there and that we're not talking about. So now (ph) we'll talk about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I've never heard you express that in here either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Well, I actually didn't mean to be hiding it from you. I actually didn't think I was, so that's very interesting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">Yeah, I'm not quite sure what to make of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Did you think you had already talked about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I felt like we have talked about it as being one of the two possibilities for the future of my life in the yeah. So (pause) yeah. So in some sense, yes. No, I don't think I've said, like, \"I'm thinking about this.\" But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: It's certainly the idea you more sort of the immediacy of it feels new.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Okay. What do you mean by immediacy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Well, as two possibilities and sort of in a general way. General isn't quite the right word. Versus something that's far more specific and on, you know, not on the surface. I don't know. Immediacy is the only word that comes to my mind. Like, \"This is something that I might do.\" It seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">to sort of take an idea and make it much more sort of practical and actionable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">Yeah, I guess I've been sitting here thinking maybe I use words differently than other people. [I don't know] (ph). In some sense, this brings us (ph) back to the conversation last time, in terms of your talking about I seem to look for some set of rules, and then everything follows from there. So there <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">are two possible outcomes. Everything follows from that. So the practical thing sort of follows immediately, in some sense, for me. But I can see how that's not (pause) in general. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561062\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">I guess I also feel like we've talked several times about (pause) you sort of asked if I thought that Tanya thought that I thought about the relationship ending or things like that. And so I feel like this is in that same family of questions, but clearly, I'm wording something differently than you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">are. If you feel like we haven't talked about that, or I haven't expressed that before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Well, it's certainly more direct than you said (inaudible 11:29) expressed yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: And it seems more present than future, if that makes sense. \"I might do this, and these are the possibilities,\" versus, \"I'm thinking about doing this.\" It seems much more I guess that's what I meant by immediacy, is more (pause) really a present focus, rather than a potential focus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yes, I said it much more directly here than I said it there. So I haven't actually said that set of words to anyone until that moment. So (pause) yeah, I don't know. I guess the immediacy piece (pause) is interesting, and I think Tanya is probably taking it a similar way, similar like this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">a thing that might happen now. But (pause) I'm not quite sure that's what I meant. (Pause) I think I felt (ph) more like, this is a thing that might happen, and I need to not be the only one aware of and acknowledging that in this situation. That I'm (pause) holding something back in order to protect <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">her, but the thing that I'm holding back is getting in the way of actually having a relationship. Because I sort of had this concern that if we spend too long talking about something, that's going to come out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: I mean, assuming (ph) that's the conversation to have, I'm thinking about leaving my wife, how does that strike you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess maybe one of the questions in that is how do you feel about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Not good, but I didn't yeah, yeah, not good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: So there's one level where I take my vows very seriously. We've talked about that before. So it feels not good in that sense. But it also feels like, I don't know, that there's (pause) there used to be a relationship here that I really, really valued, that was really important to me and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">was really good. (inaudible 17:39) So to say that I'm thinking about leaving is in some sense to say (pause) that relationship has gone so far from what it was that I don't recognize it anymore, in some fundamental ways, and I feel like (pause) I guess I feel like I'm not really known, and a few of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">my needs are met. And I don't see a way to make that better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">On the other hand, one of the reasons that I talked about this in the couple's counseling is that I feel like this is a (pause) the step towards leaving or the step towards fixing the relationship. It looks the same. We have to talk about that set of problems, in some sense. So I don't feel good about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">it in the sense that that's not a (pause) it's not really where I want my life to be. So it's sort of facing that is how I feel about the circumstances that I'm in is hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">It's also hard in the sense of, you know, what is it what do I think it says about me, that faced with that set of problems, my response is, \"I'm done here\"? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561062\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: What do you feel it does say about you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I actually don't know that I know what I feel like it says about me, but I think I am afraid that it says that I am a quitter or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">Yeah, I guess I feel a little bit like large pieces of my identity are tied up in being loyal and not quitting.

So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">But I think maybe I'm tired of being unhappy, and so (pause) now we're talking about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: I was thinking about what I was going to say when you asked that question. I think the answer is just I'm sad. I'm not really thinking about anything in particular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Can you tell me about the sadness? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: I can try. I guess I don't know how to talk about it in some sense, other than, like, I feel sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">I guess the metaphor that comes to mind I don't know (ph) particularly why is it feels like I'm in a pool of sadness, or something like that. Not drowning in it just in it. (Pause) Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: So is the pool is it water?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Sort of like a pond in the woods. Kind of dark. Kind of daytime. (Pause) There's probably a house in the distance. I don't know whether anything of that's meaningful, but that's (ph) the sort of (pause) there's the response, if I'm asked to describe it, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">So I feel like I sound sort of, like, peaceful and gloomy, but that's missing some feature that I still only have the word sadness for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">I guess I'm sort of thinking about what conversation am I going to have with Tanya next, in the context of, you know, if you are surprised by the immediacy of it, then I guess I can't feel like I'm saying something that is communicating a different thing than I mean to be communicating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Well, you said something that made an impact on Tanya on Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Do you feel somehow that you're worried you weren't communicating to her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: I feel worried that I communicated something stronger than I meant to communicate. Like, \"I'm thinking that I might leave you next week,\" or something like that. [That was too] (ph)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: \"I'm thinking about this as a possibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Or even just things are bad enough that I think about this. Maybe (ph) that's just the rephrasing of the possibility thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like it's mostly a problem with communication, or do you feel that you're feeling kind of ambivalent about it in your own mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: I definitely feel ambivalent about it, but I (pause) yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Or even ambivalent about how immediate it is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah, that might also be true. You know, realistically, there's no immediacy to it, in the sense that, like, I desperately want things to not be the way they are, but (pause) but saying that is about as much of a step as I'm at all prepared to take (pause) because I (pause) I guess I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D1\">in some sense it's an indicator of there being problems, more than anything else.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561062\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">Yeah, maybe I am ambivalent about the time scale also. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">Yeah, I think if we weren't married, I probably would have just said, \"That's enough.

(Pause) But there is a way that you can move to despair, and I wonder if that's part <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">of where your comment is coming from, that there would be something that would maybe you would gravitate toward despair at times in hearing this, imagining if you were me. That's why you feel badly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: That sounds reasonable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: I mean, I hold out a lot of hope at the end of this process. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: You mean you extend it towards others, or do you hold it yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: That's interesting. How do you say that? That's an interesting distinction. What do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: How (inaudible 39:12) hold out could mean that, like, you are holding on to a lot of hope about the process internally, and hold out could also mean, like, you are handing to me there is hope that things could be better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: I think both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: Okay. I can see both, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I think I thought about it more internally, like what you said, the former. But by extension, I think the latter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: That makes sense. Yeah, that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I imagine because I feel that way, I communicate that. But I'm also aware that that can also be communicated prematurely as a way of avoiding the pain in the present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: (inaudible 39:58) we all can just hope things will be better or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Things will be fine. Things will be great. But if they don't feel great at the moment, I could hold out hope that things will feel much better. But if they don't, if that's not the sort of current picture of your psychological state, it actually could be almost an avoidance. Sort of like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D11\">saying to someone, \"Don't worry so much.\" (Laughter) I'm not really sure that's you hope at some point they worry less, but that's not very useful at the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: (Laughter) Yeah. Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And this is whatever sort of situation you feel or what was going on in your life, the sort of pull toward despair is a compelling pull for you. It's not all there is, for sure, but it's a compelling pull. Like, \"This just sucks. Like, blaming Tanya just sucks. It's an awful place, and there's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D51\">nothing good for me to be had here.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561062\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Right. And I find my way out of it, eventually. (Pause) Yeah, I think that's correct. (Pause) So I guess my question is, like, what do I do about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Well, certainly, one thing is to appreciate that that's where you go, that that's your tendency. And it's very you know, I continue to think about this. You know, one of the ways out of it for you was to find someone who shared the similar belief that is Tanya, and in some ways, I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">you felt very close and very bonded, and very understood, which are all wonderful things. I do think there's a more problematic side, as we've talked about, in that there's a joining together against feeling like the world is a disappointing place, and that's problematic because then there's no person <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D92\">leading the other to show that there's actually good things to be had for starters. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Right. And I think it's important to add that, like, that was not the only thing going on in our relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: I appreciate that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I think that that I think you're right that was going on. And I think that when our relationship has been good, that has not been the essential or priTanya feature of it. And in the last several years, that has been a much larger feature of it. Because I think in some ways, both <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">of us have drifted much more towards despair in the last couple of years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: And I think it will be helpful. This is artificial in some ways, because this can't be done for anybody. But in some sort of framework, to sort of disentangle your despair disentangle meaning think about, not your despair for (ph) Tanya's.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: Well, that's in some sense very heavily related to this idea of leaving, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: One of the things that one of the feelings that pushes me in that direction is feeling like she has been a drain on me for several years, or has been like, I've been trying to get out of to use the language we're talking about now, to get out of despair or away from it. But she's been drifting <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E71\">more and more into it. And (pause) it's hard to swim for two people. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: And it's really, I mean, you know, early in your relationship, it was a way to actually feel hopeful because you could feel that you weren't alone in that experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: I'm not the only person who's seeing that there are bad things here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yes, and that it's sort of flipped (ph). It's kind of like my analogy. I know it was an awkward one about, you know, you sort of doing drugs (inaudible 44:40) (laughter) All of sudden, wait a second, we have a heroin addict. This is incredibly different. I wasn't realizing we were getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED1\">in this deep. And then where things flipped, where it's not sort of being in a shared experience, but it's feeling like someone is drowning and you're being dragged down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think there's a lot of yeah. Maybe it was it doesn't fit perfectly, but I think there's a lot in that analogy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: You know, James, we're going to need to stop for today, okay?
