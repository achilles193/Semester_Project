[laughs] I feel like going to bed. [laughs] I don't know why running gives me a headache, I have no idea. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: You don't want to talk today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:03:43) [laughs] Yeah, so, nothing's really happened since Monday, but I was thinking about what you said, what we talked about Monday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">You should have coffee here. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: [laughs] I'm just like, \"I just want to sleep.\" [laughs] It's really terrible, the headaches. Well, it's not terrible, but it's like...I usually have to take a headache medicine right after running. [laughs] (inaudible at 00:04:28)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">Yeah, so, about that whole equation of someone else's success necessarily means no failure. [sighs] I was thinking about that, and it's not always the case. Like this one friend of mine from BU, she recently sold her book to the giant publisher. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">I was quite surprised by my reaction, I was actually, genuinely excited and happy. For some reason, there was no equation set up between her and me. In fact, I was very encouraged. I wrote her a very nice e-mail, and she also replied back very nicely, like, \"Yeah, I can help you out. If you have any <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">questions about agents, this is how I went about it, this is what I did.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">I don't know, I just felt like she was totally open. She wasn't hiding anything, not really telling me anything at all about what she's working on. She comes across as kind of...a little silly and foolish, but gung-ho and adamant. [laughs] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">Chris (sp?) doesn't like her at all. He's always like, \"She has no substance! Look at what she's writing, it's ridiculous! She's making fun of poor people, she has no sensitivity, she's not political.\" She's got this kind of voice that has some flair and-so she's actually really successful, in a sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">that she's written for major newspapers and stuff on the web.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">At some point, I just stopped comparing myself to her. I don't know if I even did compare myself to her. She was this...not dark horse, but someone who was not literary. She was on the waitlist, so she was not the teachers' favorite. She was on the outside, it seemed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">I don't know. I knew that she got all these grants and things were going really well for her. I guess at some point I must have been jealous, but I feel like I wasn't, like I've never really compared myself to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">When she got this-she announced her book deal, I guess I was a little, for a little while, scared, and, \"Well, what the hell am I doing?\" but that didn't last very long. Then I was e-mailing her and asking her, and I want to do the same program that she did, how she met her agent (inaudible at 00:07:44).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">[sighs] I don't know. In that scenario, I feel like it was totally not...just...this thing...I wasn't anxious, (inaudible at 00:08:05) anxiety, which I feel like I have, in the case of certain other people. I wonder if it's because they're Nepalese. [laughs] Maybe I interact-I have a completely different <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">way of interacting with Nepalese than I do with Americans.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560842\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Do you feel more comparative with Nepalese?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I guess. Yeah, because...I don't know; I mean, I kind of understand [it right now] (ph). I mean...yeah, I don't know why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">Which is silly, because, if anything, I can totally compare myself to...this person. She's actually Korean-American.  She's born here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">It makes total sense for me to compare myself to her, rather than to these Nepalese, because they're elites and really elite, like their dads are directors of museums and what-not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">There's that whole class system in India that is not kind of present here or at least, ideologically. America is all about, \"You work hard and you achieve your dreams.\" There's a reward for working hard here that is not necessarily there in other countries; especially not in India, which is the reason <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">why people come here. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">All that aside, I guess ideologically I don't really understand what's going on. Why do I feel like I can compete with people like the elites of India? [laughs]  I don't really know-they're in a different class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">I guess it's the illusion of being here and sharing the same space for a while, sitting under the same roof, thinking we're friends, makes me feel like they're close to me? I don't know. I'm just surprised. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. I guess I'm just in this comparative mode. I'm tired of it [laughs] but...I guess I'm trying to figure out how to snap out of it, how to come out of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">I mean, I don't know if it's still comparative if I think, \"If she can do it, I can do it.\" [laughs] I don't know, with this Korean-American friend, I feel that's what I feel like. \"If she can do it, I can do it.\" [laughs] Is that comparative?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Not in the way we're talking about. If anything, that was sort of what I was talking about on Monday, in terms of what could happen for you but doesn't with other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, there was so many people with which it doesn't happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Or even being-when you're out with Nelson (sp?) and feeling, rather than strength by association, you feel like an outsider. In a sense, what you're describing with this one friend, that you do feel strength by association, [in a sense] (ph), \"If she can do it, I can do it.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I did. I felt weirdly strengthened. I don't know where it came from, [laughs] but it was there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">I mean, it could be the way that she interacted with me. She was open and friendly and encouraging and-and not overtly so. She didn't go out of the way to be encouraging, but-I mean, she always has been a little bit like, \"Oh, yeah, so you're a literary (inaudible at 00:12:35), you taught me this, your <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">language is so good that...\" All these things have already been said. They've only been said once or twice, but that's enough to give this kind of friendship a positive spin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">But yeah, I would-maybe it's not an Nepalese thing, but I'm pretty sure it is an Nepalese thing, (inaudible at 00:13:01) with Nepalese I don't feel strengthened. I feel kind of pulled down. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: What do you mean, when out with Nelson, I feel like an outsider?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: You were describing, a couple times when you're talking about being at a party with him, being with his friends and feeling like an outsider rather than feeling like, \"Oh, I'm with him. I've been invited by him.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560842\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: That's (inaudible at 00:13:46).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, that whole thing was so weird. I guess it happened once in a mild way, very early on.  It was the first time he'd taken me to one of his friend's place, and it was just this one guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">You know, I felt a little bit of an outsider. I mean, I did. But then, that feeling (inaudible at 00:14:15) escalated and erupted in everyone's face in that Thanksgiving dinner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">Once again, we went to this same guy's place and there was a party, other people were there. And I had this fight with this woman. She was like, \"You (inaudible at 00:14:33).\" [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">That outsider feeling really was like crawling through my skin and in my veins. It was very intense, because that's all I could feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">[sighs] I don't know. I'm trying to understand. I mean, I was an outsider. It's not psychological. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: When you say, \"I was,\" what are you referring to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: I mean at that Thanksgiving party, I was an outsider. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: How are you defining it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: In the sense that [laughs] that's a circle and these people know each other for several years. That was the second or the third time they were meeting me. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">I mean, I see what I-I'm trying to understand this, because-so when I went-I took, to another gathering, I took my friend with me, this friend that I was helping with his Ph. D. applications.  I don't think he would feel like an outsider like so intensely, the way that I feel it. He was fine, he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">doing everything that everyone else was doing and having a drink or dancing or talking and suggesting songs and just being naturally-yeah, just being natural.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">I mean, he did mean early, and by early, it's 1:00 a.m. instead of 3:00 a.m., but... [sighs] That was the only difference. He was more polite and thanking the host and that was it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">But for me, it's like, whoa, I have to be very careful and clearly, I'm not very careful [laughs] because I scream at people.  It's like...I don't know. I don't understand it (inaudible at 00:17:11).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: I don't know, at that party, it just felt like everyone was just...there to judge me and...because I was there as Nelson's date, I felt like (inaudible at 00:17:46) they were all like, \"Oh, what is she all about?\" and, \"What does she do?\" \"She's poor,\" or whatever. \"She doesn't have a corporate <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">job,\" and, \"She doesn't have a Ph. D. What is she doing?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">I don't know. I just felt like that's what people must have been thinking, but I know they weren't. [laughs] They weren't even thinking about me. Chris says, \"Clearly, people don't even think about you,\" [laughs] \"so you have nothing to worry about.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: And they were talking, I guess, amongst themselves, because then (ph) they knew each other well-not that they didn't talk to me, they were being just fine. They were being nice, actually. But I guess it was like they weren't going to talk to me and they were going to ignore me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">I remember feeling of, \"I just want to die,\" or, \"I just want to disappear,\" \"I just want to go away.\" It's like two feelings conflicting.  It's like you want to impress them and be the center of attention, but at the same time you want to kind of put yourself in a hole and disappear. [laughs] It's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">like both these feelings are completely opposite one another. You feel pulled in both directions, and very intensely.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560842\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: And it reminds me, it totally reminds me my previous experience with my childhood. [laughs] Of groups and cliques and a circle of friends, wanting desperately to be a part of them, to gain recognition and [sighs] attention.  But then being mistreated and being ignored. Then wanting to prove <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">them that they're idiots for-I feel mad at them. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">Like with this girl my mom used to tutor...the one that she kind of liked. The one who was teenager and she and I had some, whatever, sexual experience, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">She had parties and she wouldn't invite me, because we lived so close to each other, we could hear the parties in the lawn and their garden. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">I remember this one time clearly that I really wanted to go, because she's like, \"There's going to be this, there's going to be that, you're helping prepare for the party,\" a little bit, I kind of remember that now. But the actual evening of the party, there's music and you can hear them and stuff, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">but you can't really go down and join them. [laughs] Because they're wearing nice clothes and you're not. You're in your pajamas.

You know all my deep, dirty secrets, but when it comes time for me to be social and have a good time, you're not invited.\" [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">That made me feel like a poor (inaudible at 00:22:25). [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: How much do you bring this experience into all your current experiences, where the context and the circumstances are so different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: I know, but I just don't understand why do I do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">I have no idea. That's what I'm saying, they were actually being nice. They were actually-these people at Thanksgiving, they actually wanted to hear from me.  They were telling me to stop cooking and join them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">I don't know why I go lapse into that mode of thinking, where people are not going to be nice when they actually are nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">I guess it's some kind of fear, maybe, that they won't be nice, or I'll disappoint them and then I do disappoint them! [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Why does it work that way? [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: I guess I was just got it into my head that I'm not good enough for these people, and maybe I'm not or these people as in certain people. I guess that's because of the competitive mode, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">To have a nicer place, a nicer job, and at this point, I know everyone has a nice job than me, because, you know, I'm a student, so I don't make any money. Nicer job, nicer place, Ph. D.  It's automatically, I jack them up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">Then I think that they will judge me and think me stupid, foolish, whatever. [sighs] I automatically am on the defense mode, defense\/offense. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">It's not rational at all, because-and the same people have at some point already said, \"Oh, you've got so many degrees,\" and, \"What you're doing is so brave.\" I, myself, kind of think that, \"Yeah, these people have good jobs and they make good money, but they work ridiculous hours.  I don't have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">do that. I have other kinds of things in my life. I can cook really well and I can do whatever I want whenever I want.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560842\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: I feel like saying that, \"Oh, but if they just accept me for who I am, then I'll be nice to them, always,\" but that's not true, because they do, at some point, in their own way, accept me for who I am, [laughs] so that's not the reason. [laughs] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: This whole power-by-association thing, it's good but I kind of take it with a grain of salt, because with Chris, that's what was supposed to happen and it did, for a bit. I felt smart, because he was smart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">But then, when he got his job-and we already knew that this was going to happen, we were talking about it and joking about it. But when it happened, it really felt like, it was like, \"Oh, yeah, that's...\" It was different when it happened than we were it anticipating it.  Yeah, so I did help him do <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB1\">interviews for his dissertation and all, but [sighs] none of that-I didn't get anything. He got the job, he got the Ph. D.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">But again, we knew that that was the case. [laughs] I wasn't going to get a little MA in Economics just because I'm helping him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: I felt, at that point, a very profound sense of almost betrayal. There was no power-by-association, I just wanted to push that away because I was like, \"What does this mean?  What is this power-by-association?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">Now, if I were smart, [laughs] or practical, I would have thought, \"Okay, this is a time I (inaudible at 00:29:14) what people expected me to do. This is the time to get married, because then I would not have to worry about money. I would not have to worry about money from UMB,\" because as a spouse, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">I would get free tuition and stuff.

He has a job and I have money to buy shoes now?\" [laughs] That's how I thought of what I would get, associating with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">I try to feel that way with Nelson so I can do things differently, but there's a clear distinction in my head. It's like his money. It's not like just because we're dating, I have access to his money. Obviously not. I don't know, maybe it can mean that I'll get free drinks once in a while. [laughs] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">I try to feel power-by-association in a sense that it's he's confident and he's got all this energy, so I feel like I should emulate that or I should feel confident. Yeah, I think that's about as far as I've gotten (ph) [laughs] with this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">His whole feeling that he can do anything, so I feel like, \"If he feels like he can do anything, I certainly should feel that I can do something.\" [laughs] Not as a competitive thing, but just like...I don't know. He feels it; he must have some reason to feel it! [laughs] Even if I don't see that reason <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD1\">for myself, I just go ahead and feel it.
