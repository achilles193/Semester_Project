data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: \u2026eight different [inaudible] but [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Did you [inaudible] recording thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I do it with my phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: [inaudible] do what you just did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I just do it on a phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Wow. Yeah, I guess that was like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s just\u2026 not just for recording.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah, but still, that\u2019s a lot of stuff. I think I\u2019ve had my laptop for three years, and it\u2019s nothing special and I\u2019ve used a quarter of the memory space. And that\u2019s with the years when I was downloading basically every article that I could find that was available in pdf for all of [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Tanya\u2019s [ph?] on the iPad and I [inaudible] much smaller probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: It is cold out there. I went for a walk before this because I was like I have to get out of the apartment, serious cabin fever, and it\u2019s really cold. I have a friend who posted on Facebook a couple of weeks ago that sort of hikers adage of there\u2019s no such thing as bad weather, just bad gear. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">[1:34] So I\u2019m trying to remember that. So yeah, nothing\u2019s really happening since I saw you yesterday, other than me watching a lot of TV and knitting a lot. A lot. I finished the hat that looks like a shark is eating the kid\u2019s head for [inaudible] It\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m really proud of myself. It\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">there\u2019s ear flaps that are the side fins and there\u2019s a fin on the top and a tail on the back. And then the front is teeth. It\u2019s a little goofy. That\u2019s why there\u2019s small children who will wear it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Probably not if you\u2019re a five or six year old boy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. It\u2019s just going to be awesome. So that\u2019s pretty much what I did yesterday. And so far today. (pause) Yeah, I\u2019m about done with vacation. I\u2019m ready to go back to work. (pause) I feel like I sort of just have either off or on sometimes, of when I have a break I don\u2019t do dishes, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">don\u2019t do anything. [3:20] James and I are rewatching Sherlock. Have you seen that? You should watch that. It\u2019s really good. Somehow or other we have at least three copies of the complete works of Sherlock Holmes in our\u2026 between the two of us, so\u2026 multiple shorter volumes also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I have read the stories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I can\u2019t remember what\u2026 I think I gave him a copy of the complete works when we were first dating in college, and then, I don\u2019t know, everybody seems to think we\u2019ll like them, which we do. Both of us do, I think for different reasons. [4:28] But now we have a lot of copies. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">I\u2019m still pretty worried about our marriage but I don\u2019t really know what to do about it. [inaudible] or rather I know what I can do and I feel like I\u2019m doing those things, but I don\u2019t know whether that will be enough. My friend Heather Kate, we\u2026 so every year, the day after Christmas, four to six or <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">so friends and I get together and have lunch at this restaurant in San Antonio that is kind of overpriced and not that good. It was actually really good about ten years ago when we graduated from high school and it\u2019s sort of gone down, [inaudible] since then. But we haven\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think any of us <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200273\">live in San Antonio anymore so we haven\u2019t found any place, despite the fact that there are a lot more good restaurants in San Antonio now than there were ten years ago. [6:12] But so we go to the same place and spend a lot of money on just food that\u2019s sometimes okay. So this year Heather Kate is\u2026 she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200274\">pregnant with her second child and she\u2019s\u2026 she\u2026 I\u2019ve sort of talked about her I think. She is\u2026 she was my best friend in high school. She\u2019s also sort of been dealing with depression her whole life. She had a pretty terrible eating disorder, actually since I\u2019ve known her. But it got really bad in college <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200275\">and she sort of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562090\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Anorexia or bulimia?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Both. It was bulimia when we were in high school and then I think in college she got pretty\u2026 a pretty dangerously low weight. And so, yeah, and she\u2019s sort of my hero, or one of my heroes. She\u2026 it\u2019s always sort of hard for me to tell how she\u2019s doing at any given time but she just tackles it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">She doesn\u2019t try to pretend it\u2019s not happening. She just tackles it. One of the things that she has sort of evolved into doing is she just tells everybody everything about everything. She\u2019s just like I don\u2019t\u2026 she doesn\u2019t\u2026 yeah. But so she was like well Diego and I are basically\u2026 she told us that she <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">thought about leaving Diego over the last year, who\u2019s her husband, who\u2026 they\u2019ve dated since they were in high school. So in a weird twisted event, he\u2019s both the son of our high school principal and the\u2026 Amanda\u2019s ex-boyfriend\u2019s college roommate. [8:12] He was best friends with this guy who Amanda dated <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">on and off through high school and college, and he turned out to be a pretty bad dude. But Diego doesn\u2019t [inaudible] best friends. And so he\u2019s a great person, just really good for Heather, and they\u2019ve been really good together. And she sort of said well, I was thinking about leaving him. And they went <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B4\">to counseling and they\u2019re apparently doing a lot better now. Sorry, I feel like I sort of fought one thing one moment and then the time it took to tell all of the things related to that moment were a lot more intensive than that really warranted. But well I\u2019m here now. What I was thinking about was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B5\">that I was telling Amanda about this later because Amanda got very close to Heather Kate when they were both living in Philadelphia, and she said yeah, Heather told me about a year ago that she and Diego were having a lot of\u2026 were having trouble, but she told me not to tell anybody. So I\u2019m really glad <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B6\">to hear that they\u2019re doing well. And I said oh, I was sort of kind of sad that Tanya hadn\u2019t told me. And several days later this sort of came up with James. And he was like Tanya told you too, you just forgot. I was like oh, well, I guess that\u2019s good. I don\u2019t know. [10:01] (pause) Yeah, that was sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B7\">of a long story short [inaudible] it was kind of James to fill me in. And I hope Heather and Diego are okay. My mom had a picture of\u2026 one of the many pictures of me at her house. She had a picture of me and Heather Kate at our high school graduation which we had\u2026 tend to refer to as that time we got <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B8\">gay married to each other because it was white dresses and\u2026 yeah, it was ridiculous. (pause) I feel like we\u2019re sort of\u2026 your friends sort of go in waves. [12:24] I feel like there\u2019s sort of the wave of\u2026 there\u2019s\u2026 or the first wave of people getting married and then the first wave of people having babies <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B9\">and now I\u2019m just sort of hitting the first wave of my peers having trouble with their marriages, which I guess makes sense. I mean three to five years in. But it\u2019s hard. Amanda was telling me about another woman that I went to high school with, and then college. I didn\u2019t actually\u2026 Amanda was good friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B10\">with her about a year ago in San Antonio, but I did not... I wasn\u2019t really in touch with her. I don\u2019t really know her well but I sort of keep up with her on Facebook and read her blog and stuff. But she, I think, got pregnant unexpectedly when she was in college, and so she and her husband decided to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B11\">get married when they were 20 and finish college. And she just had her third child. She\u2019s a couple of years younger than I am so she\u2019s 26 or so. And Amanda said that she and her husband Henry were having some real problems in their marriage and the way they decided to deal with it was to just say well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B12\">we\u2019re just going to focus on each other and on our family and sort of let all of our other friendships and commitments go by the wayside. [14:07] Which I think has been tough on Amanda. And feels like not really the best strategy to me, but it\u2019s not me. But I don\u2019t know. She just had her third daughter <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B13\">three days ago. I don\u2019t know (pause) [inaudible] (pause) [inaudible] I just feel like, I don\u2019t know, I feel distant from everybody, or distant from all these people who used to be in my life. [17:17] I have\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562090\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] going with kind of abandoned. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s necessarily true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. Mostly I just feel like I need to work harder to be in touch with people I don\u2019t\u2026 but I just don\u2019t do it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: My impression is [ph?] playing hurt [ph?] about what I said?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: No, and more of it\u2019s in some ways it feels like it fits; in some ways it doesn\u2019t feel like it fits. And I\u2019m sort of trying to figure that out. [18:50] (pause) Maybe it does sort of\u2026 I do sort of feel abandoned but that doesn\u2019t make sense. I don\u2019t\u2026 yeah. (pause) I have an acquaintance from William <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">&amp; Mary to whom I lent a book about six months ago. And he just got it back to me three days ago. I wasn\u2019t expecting him to. I was expecting that I would have to track him down and beat him over the head, but no, he got it back to me eventually. And we\u2019re not really friends, I just\u2026 he asked if anybody <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200332\">had this book and I said yes, please borrow it. But so we chatted for about ten minutes and then he was sort of like oh, we should get together those sort of people from William &amp; Mary who are living in Denver. He\u2019s like there are a lot of people that I went to school with who are here, at least four <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200333\">or five. And I sort of said sure, you do that and I will show up. That sounds great. [20:28] (pause) And part of me is like yes, I would show up. That would be great. And part of me thinks that would just be really weird. I don\u2019t know. (pause) I guess it just feels like I\u2019m not really a necessary part <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200334\">of anybody\u2019s life right now. One way of looking at that is well, over the last couple of years I just dropped out of everybody else\u2019s life, and it\u2019s harder to put myself sort of back in. (pause) I don\u2019t know. I think that\u2019s probably less true in reality than it feels like today. [22:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: I imagine, though, that that feeling puts you on shaky ground, in your mind, talking about what\u2019s really important and what\u2019s really going on with you to other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562090\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">CLIENT: You mean talking about it puts me on shaky ground?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: Feeling not necessary. It reminds me a bit of\u2026 so we talk about if you and me were\u2026 you\u2026 I think everybody\u2026 actually I don\u2019t know how to take care of me or what to do for me. [23:41] I guess I\u2019m imagining that it\u2019s similar, or it\u2019s related. It makes my interest or investment or commitment <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">to you, to what\u2019s going on with you, more intangiment. [ph?] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: I sort of feel like as soon as I am sort of feeling like sad and lonely, and as soon as I identify this as I think this is what\u2019s going on right then, I just try to shut it off, like stop whining about it, or this is very melodramatic of you or\u2026 and so on and so on. [25:03] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I think you really better not say that out loud.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause) Mom talked, when we met with her\u2026 met her, about how it used to be that she took care of everybody else instead of herself, and now she\u2019s taking care of herself and is really proud of that. [26:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry, can I back up a little bit? I mean it seemed to me that the thing that you did say is just the sort of thing that\u2019s hard to say, to acknowledge that it feels like such a bad idea, and you\u2019re so scared to elaborate what you think and feel that you very quickly shut yourself down. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">It seems like just the sort of thing that I would think is very scary to say to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, or sort of the other way also. When I find myself coming up with lots and lots of different reasons why what I\u2019m thinking is wrong, it\u2019s usually worth saying. [27:49] (pause) Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I miss being close to people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: Your depression getting worse has really been much harder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like I just dropped everybody. Yeah, and I think about Kirsten, the\u2026 who I used to room with, and it really bothers me that we\u2019re not in contact anymore. I\u2019m really angry at her and I don\u2019t know why I keep\u2026 it keeps bothering me. [29:34] But, yeah, I don\u2019t know. I guess maybe I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">just afraid that I just really dropped her when things got really bad and that she doesn\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s not so much that I want to be friends with her it\u2019s that I\u2026 it really bothers me that she doesn\u2019t want to be friends with me. I don\u2019t know, in a way it doesn\u2019t usually bother me when people don\u2019t like me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200472\">I mean it\u2019s not very often that people don\u2019t like me but when it does it\u2019s usually pretty clearly we\u2019re just not very interested in each other. [30:44] (pause) [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: Well [inaudible] is that (pause) for a while she saw how it was with you and I would imagine some of how depressed you really were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: I wonder whether she did though. I don\u2019t actually remember but I wonder whether\u2026 I work pretty hard to sort of keep everything shut down in front of other people and I don\u2019t know whether I succeeded in that. I don\u2019t, yeah, I just don\u2019t remember. [32:06] (pause) Well I didn\u2019t really want to let <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">you finish that sentence today. (pause) Yeah, I guess I find that very hard to imagine, that she did see how bad things were for me or what it was like when things are that bad, that that would make her not want to be in touch with me anymore. Probably because I feel like that would just be really shitty <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B2\">of her. That\u2019s just bad. That\u2019s not good.
