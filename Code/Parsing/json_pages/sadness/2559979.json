I could have written you back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Well it's two thirty five. I was going by the clock and it was a different time. THERAPIST: Oh okay. Yeah that's right, it's a couple of minutes different than mine. I see. So (very long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: So the last I guess we met, I forgot, were we Tuesday a while ago or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Yeah, about week and a half ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. After that, I'd sort of been [casting up] (ph).. I forget what happened. Maybe that was after my trip to Vancouver.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Okay. Yeah, but right after that I just was Oh yeah, I had fixed my flat tire. So I went over to the meeting house and a lot of the whats-a-ma-callits were there, the center residents. And so I asked them to open the storage room for me so I could some (inaudible at 00:02:58) or whatever I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">would need. But the thing was just riddled with (inaudible) so I had to get carts (ph) and whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">The point was by the time I had gotten my products and come back it was kind of late. I had had a few conversations with the girl there. And so we decided to go out and sort of drink a bottle of wine on the River. And it was nice. I felt like I established a pretty quick connection to her through talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">about the Hamptons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">And I mentioned something about the Hamptons or my grandfather building a house there after the war and my experiences as a kid. And she said, \"Oh my gosh, you're explaining (ph) my life.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: We, you know, I was holding her and whatever. She wouldn't kiss me though. It was kind of weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: She wouldn't kiss you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: She wouldn't. Or if I like I tried and she just wouldn't let me. I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: But holding each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Right. Sure. I take that now she must have Well I don't know. [I don't know what she was doing.] (ph) Yeah, so we kind of agreed to meet on Monday. I asked her what she wanted to do, she asked about if I cook. I said, yeah, I could probably cook you some stuff. But she said she doesn't eat <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">no kind of meet or eggs and like all kinds of shit. So she said she would make something, that she'd come over and like watch Madmen or something. So that was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">I went away for the July Fourth weekend. Actually, we both went to different parts of the Hamptons. And she just sort of reconnected with her family and I went to reconnect with mine. The weekend started out for me, my cousin Seth, the engineer, whose parents I feel like look down on me or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">It's not necessary to go into extensive detail, but we had arranged to sort of, he asked me if I wanted to ride down. You know, I hadn't seen the family for a while or been out to the Hamptons for a while. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">He said, \"Oh, you want a ride down?\" And I said, \"Oh, I'll think about it.\" And that was maybe two weeks before. And then so two days before I sent Facebook messages and e-mails saying, you know, \"When are you coming to pick me up?\" Or, \"What do you want to do?\" I had the option of taking off Thursday <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">and Friday or just Friday, so I wanted to sort of coordinate with him to see when he was going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">But he just didn't respond so I ended up having to sort of hustle for a bus ride. I mean literally, I just like ran through Providence with a guitar and a backpack with my swim trunks in it -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559979\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: to catch a bus to get down there on July Fourth. So I took -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: No word back from him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: No word back. So I got there and it's one of those things that's just kind of, it's cold. I would never bring it up. It's just it's not really something I could forgive. So I just went down there and it was very different from any other experience I've had there, because I wasn't I can't say <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">it's gone for good but I wasn't catering to this idea of being sensitive to the family's needs. Or trying to fit in to, you know, my aunts and uncles ideas of how things work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">I was me and they were going to get used to it. And it was alright. I also, it's unusual because it's like they, my aunts and uncles, have sort of stocked the place and it's like their liquor, their food. But I just kind of used it without feeling too bad about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I did a few chores over the course of the weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: This cousin never said anything to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: No, no. But I got there and we had a cookout and then we played basketball. Yeah, like first thing I show up, I show up by my sister's boyfriend, the French guy, he's there and he said, \"Are you okay?\" And I started giving him my quizzical look and he said, \"Are you okay?\" I'm showing up, I'm, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">you know, tan and I think I look pretty good. I have all my stuff, I just took a bus down. And he's French so I say, \"Do you mean 'How's it going?'\" or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">So it's just we went up and played basketball and my team did pretty well. And it got kind of physical on the brother, you know the brother, the younger brother of the kid who didn't give me the ride, I sort of roughed him up a little bit and he sort of left the game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Hm. Was it payback?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I said, \"You guys had enough? \" (laughs) There was a pause and then, \"I think we're going to down to the house now.\" And I said, \"Yeah, that's right.\" And it was that kind of stuff. Or that's how I look at it. I mean I played a song that night and I knew it was good, but it was strange because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">it didn't register.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Like it was great. It was \"Lone Star\" by Howard Jones. Do you know that one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I don't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Well it's good. But it's just maybe it's not what they're used to or whatever. But it was like, I know it's good, but after I played people started like packing up and leaving. I feel like pretty strange. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Well that's the tone. It's like I'm just there and I am who I am and, you know. I'm not fitting in all that well but it's, you know, kind of it's like a military outlook. I'm just sort of there and there's conflict and I'm, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I was thinking that it seems to me that you feel this sense of, my sense is that you feel like there's this sense of being somewhat of an outsider now based upon kind of where you are with work and career and all that stuff to them. And you feel kind of like they look at you with some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">kind of mix of sympathy and kind of some vague disappointment or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: They do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: And you try to feel like, \"Wow,\" I mean it must feel lousy. And what are you supposed to do except for try to steel yourself to all that? Kind of who wants to be <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559979\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It is. It's like that. Although I hadn't made the connection to my career, my work. That's certainly part of it. But I like these people and I value my connection to them, but it seems like it' conditional upon that sort of doting some sort piteous energy directed towards me. I have no <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">idea, you know. But yeah, everyone drank a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">But it's strange because the cousins have grown older and my oldest cousin on that side was interested in beer pong. So I played beer pong and the cellar instead of smelling like sort of the warm, it's like a venerable cedar smell that usually sits in the cellar, it smelled like disgusting beer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Grit, mold. But, anyway -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Hm. Unpleasant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: What's that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Unpleasant odor, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah. (pause) There was this 5K that everyone was set on running that's down by the beach. Just an informal thing. There are some professional runners but some not. It supports the community (inaudible at 00:11:49) or something just at the beach we all go to. And so everybody was interested <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">in running that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">After the night, Friday night, a lot of people drank a lot and so about half as many people decided to actually run or were awake in time to run. I was one of those people. I didn't sleep much and I drank too. But it started at eight thirty and I got up at like seven forty and took a shower and started to eat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">At eight twenty I was finishing my bowl of cereal in my underwear when I took this rickety bike down to the beach. I got twenty dollars out of an ATM and then biked to the registration table and laid it out. And as I was at the registration table like two hundred runners behind me took off. The race <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">started. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">So they threw a number at me and four safety pins and they're like, \"Put it on as you go.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: So I took my time actually. I needed to give them my accessories, like my hat and sunglasses and change and all that, and get it out of my pockets. So they got like a two minute head start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: But I still beat the half the field and I beat everyone in my family, more importantly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: So I was making this shit a I feel like I established myself and I sort of, I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, established yourself. What, what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: That's too strong. I, in some Brandon sense, of putting them in their place. (laughs) But it's not like a happy time it's just like a shallow satisfaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: No, I hear, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: So that's what the weekend was like for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: And that girl I was talking about, for her, I guess during the weekend her father left or something, her family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Left the family?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Right. I mean, from my point of view, you know, I'm waiting there Monday night having had this sort of dry and arrogant (ph) and average experience with my family. And I'm just really sort of banking on the cool touch of a woman or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Being cooked for, whatever. And, you know, she bows out because her father left her family. I don't care if her whole family is massacred (laughs), all I sense is I'm being stood up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Ah. Uh huh. Well, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559979\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Right. So I don't know how to delve into that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Delve into that? Well how do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Well, my first response is to be like, \"Do you always chicken out this dramatically?\" Because we had a real connection and she, even at that time, she would send like We'd have this conversation and she was saying how I'm a man so I'm scary. And I said, \"Well, (laughs) I've always wondered <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">about that. What's scary about men?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">And she's like, \"Oh, they might take my heart and break it into little pieces.\" She had these concerns about loving someone too much and then it's not reciprocated and whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: So, I felt like that was a big part of it for her, whatever her excuse was nominally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: And then she said her father leaves the family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Right. So it's like I sort of hesitate before shooting back a response like that, and instead decided to take the solicitous act. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: She might want to know what you're going to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: It's just me feeling vulnerable, you know. And now, you know, I've made contact with her again. And I think she still has interest in me, but it's this sort of thing where I, at the advice of Edgar, my roommate, I sort of said (laughs) something like, I said like, I used \"I\" statements and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">said like, \"I really like you but I feel like I might like you more than you like me. So I'm probably going to back away.\" And then she said something back with \"I\" statements, saying like, \"You know, that's probably safe for us both that I back away.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">But then every text message I send her she sends these long ass text messages. Like she says, \"I'm busy with work this week.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, what's work like.\" And she sends like twenty lines of text describing everything that she's doing. She gave me her schedule for the entire week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: I don't know. I'm not, in these situations, I'm not sure whether I should jump on this and say like, \"Let's meet at this time,\" or whether I should just take her sort of cues to leave as poor indications. Where I stand now, I saw her on Tuesday and the way she was is that she takes this tone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">I don't know if she's watched too much \"Law and Order\" or something, but it's like she's explaining the hard facts of life to me. (laughs) And I'm just listening but it sounds kind of ridiculous coming from her, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: What were the hard facts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: You know, like, \"My Dad leaving the seven year old girl at home. She's seven years old. What's he going to do when she's smoking a cigarette?\" And like, \"Seven year old girl,\" da da da. Some sort of punctuation in the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: in the delivery. And so I feel like I'm being relegated to that, I don't know. I feel like there's some other guy involved and she's just not saying anything. Because who doesn't kiss you when you're like embraced or you know lying together on the grass? It's just weird. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Maybe, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: I also, I could have pushed it at that point and probably had sex with her that night because, first of all, I have a key to where she lives. And although she's kind of pushing away verbally I think she probably would have taken me in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: She what? That Tuesday night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because she said something like what she was worried about, like (inaudible at 00:18:12) or whatever, da da da da da da. And so she has these defenses but, you know, once she's with someone all the walls come down and she's completely whatever, completely open. So I said, \"Yeah. I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD1\">be wanting to allow that to exist.\" Or, \"I'd be happy if that existed even if it wasn't for me necessarily.\" So I didn't push on that occasion but maybe I should have. Who knows?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559979\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: But it leaves me feeling like I can't be myself though. Because my response to these things is kind of like I feel like she's not being straight with me in certain instances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Or there are certain key -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: You don't believe her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, but at this rate she's just describing Like her parents were already separated and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: She's making it out like she's incredibly busy all the time. And if that's a ploy I don't really care. It's just like maybe I'm too sensitive to that stuff. But before she was trying to help me. That Tuesday night she was saying like, \"You know, I'm available this day and this day.\" She proposed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">the date after the weekend to meet again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">Now it's just like I can't. I can't do anything. I'll text her to like, \"Hey, so you want to talk about something on the phone?\" And she's like, \"I can't. I have work.\" Or, you know, I started singing a song and I said, \"Do you want to hear a song?\" And she said, \"I can't, I have work.\" Or, \"I can't,\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF1\">because she goes up to [visit her Mom] (ph), or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">So it's sort of a sad thing for me because I actually felt this is not just some shallow principle thing. Like I felt a genuine connection, especially with the Hamptons thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: And maybe it's just a door that is shut. That seems like that's what that means symbolically. So I just can't really climb back to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. It's also she really did kind of, you know, open up to some extent and then she goes to this business of, \"My father's left.\" Something about the dangers of men. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: She sounds kind of trepidatious. Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And I think you're also saying, God, you felt like a taste of a certain degree of intimacy and wanted more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. But I think she thinks that I'm like on a string or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Like a victim of love or something. But, you know, in the past I would be sort of emotionally invested and probably angry at her for trying to manipulate me or something. And now I think I sort of recognize the same machinations that have bothered me in the past. But instead of being angry I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E51\">just sort of puzzled. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">I mean I feel like I'm, I mean I'm not incredibly attractive, but I look alright. I'm pretty popular in terms of where she lives and works. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: What do you think? Do you think she likes you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: I think That's just it. I don't understand why she's not like crazy to meet with me or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: It sounds like such a stupid thing but that's exactly how I feel. I was just like that's my (laughs) query or my puzzlement or bewilderment. I just don't understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: How am I not intensely desirable? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Well I guess you get the feeling, though, that she does like you. That she finds you appealing, and yet she's kind of, you know, trepidatious.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559979\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: I think she, at this point, she feels like I'm too available because I've been the one always pushing her. Although she responds with these huge text messages it's just kind of me sort of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Well, you know, it doesn't seem like you've been I mean, I guess you've been pushing it in response to kind of this ambivalence that she shows you. But I don't hear you, you know, climbing down her throat. You know, like it didn't seem to me like you were desperate to see her, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F91\">and start text messaging her or calling her. I mean, it seemed more like (laughs) she seemed to, as you were saying, your thought about her What did she do? She cancelled plans?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah, she cancelled. I texted her the night before to confirm and she texted back at like four in the morning saying her father left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: I don't think it had much to do with you being available as much as something inside of her that's, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: I saw her like two days later. She seemed like she was genuinely grieving. She [looked pretty bad.] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah, you seem to equate a lot of kind of like women's, you know, ambivalence towards you to have to do a lot with you being too eager.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: Like your eagerness is a turn off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: Something like that, yeah. I recognize it as a strength. Like your ability to share things that are intimate, or to put significance out there, significant emotional feelings, sort of significant personal experience on the table, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">THERAPIST: I think you do too. But I think there's also another side to it which is that it makes you feel like you've put too much of yourself out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">CLIENT: Exactly, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">THERAPIST: And now they have a certain amount of I mean there really is a certain amount of power, a certain amount of like they have the right to say \"yay\" or \"nay.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) (inaudible at 00:25:02) So I feel like I can't be myself. It's weird. Like I wish this were something that just came naturally. I feel sexually impoverished.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">CLIENT: And I wouldn't talk about it so much if I were getting what I needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">CLIENT: Or a natural part of me. I think I talk about it a lot because I just need some sort of outlet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">THERAPIST: [It's frustrating. Wow.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">CLIENT: I'm frustrated.

(pause) Yeah, I mean, you're feeling very, you know I think what, as you just put it, really want sexual connection. You want to feel a body. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">THERAPIST: And yet, when you do I think you feel this terrible vulnerability too, because it's really, you really, really want it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">CLIENT: I mean I've taken conscious steps to pursue this. And it makes me think maybe I'm trying to hard or it's too convoluted. I'm not being myself. But at the same time if I sort of shut that door, which I've been thinking about for a while. If I just shut that door and said, \"Okay, I'm not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B1\">to, you know, go pussy hunting anymore,\" inevitably, no matter how much I build myself up, let's say tomorrow I'm on the cover of Time Magazine as some business magnate, it doesn't matter. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2013A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559979\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">It's still like there's no way that that temptation is not going to be able to return me to rubble.

I don't know how to phrase this right, but I sort of burned the home when I went back to the Hamptons. I beat the race.

But something with her, it seems like, is critical, in that it kind of felt like, \"Oh, I can do a lot. I want to be out in the world,\" and all this. And, \"I can handle my parents and all this if you have June.\" And then <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B1\">when you lost, it was like you lost a lot of will. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

It's just like I'm (laughs) kind of a whore, but I'm taking money from different people and taking favors from different people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">CLIENT: I'm not a whore but like one of those women who just depend on someone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">CLIENT: It's just switching, switching patrons in some sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what I sense though is that you don't feel necessarily pity from these people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">CLIENT: That's right. That's right. That's it. (pause) Also, I'm looking forward to the family reunion on my mother's side at the end of the month. But my mother's brother he offered me suits. I don't know what to do. I feel like I should take the suits from my uncle but I have one suit I bought myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D1\">for ten dollars. It's pretty good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Well, what do you feel about the offer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: Well I don't want my mother to be involved. I could use suits, I guess, but it's almost like that too. I mean after that weekend, the July Fourth weekend, and June not coming over, I haven't been doing anything. I've just been on my heels just kind of showing up for work. You know? Just getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201811\">by and showing up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">THERAPIST: Mm.

Yeah. Well, I think yeah, I mean June in a way is a I mean, I was thinking one thing that seems to come from a woman for you, not just the physical needs and the kind of connection of minds, but some way that somebody feels good about you. You know, like a really clear sense of being <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F1\">loved (laughs) and valued in some way that I think you're needing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">THERAPIST: You know, I hear that in the frustration you feel. Like, \"Well, why the hell can't this \" I mean, \"What is June not seeing?\" (laughs) You know? Like, why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I'm kind of like an acrobat but how often are you going do these spectacular things just for nobody?

Yeah, I just let it out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20255\">THERAPIST: Hm. Did you feel like he was doing it so he could just continue to have the private moment with your sister? Was that the feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20257\">CLIENT: No. It was my brother throwing the ball.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20259\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But he kept making you go back in the water? Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It was very close. I don't think he did it intentionally, but the effect was the same. I was being drawn away from the intercourse with the rest of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025F\">CLIENT: So I just got pissed off. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20261\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Right. Yeah. Huh. (pause) I was thinking that in a way it sounded like it would have been, again, this kind of like exposure or even been revealing like how much you wanted to be around them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20263\">CLIENT: If I did what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20265\">THERAPIST: Yeah. When you left the ball behind and walked towards them. That's sort of saying, \"I don't give a shit about the ball, I want to be with you guys.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20267\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20269\">THERAPIST: And yes, it sort of again, that feeling of how bad you need it and want it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026B\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026D\">THERAPIST: That's what I sense. Kind of like, you know, asking June out on a date on a Thursday. Like it would be revealing. \"I want you.\" And you're putting your neck out there. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026F\">CLIENT: Right. In the situation in the water, though, I came off like an asshole.
