(laughs) Versus\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: So I cannot wait to get the fuck out of here. Yeah, I\u2019m done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: You mean to Assyria?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, not out of here. Yeah, I\u2019m done. This could not be better. Life is about timing, a lot of times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Everything feels right. I think it\u2019s coinciding with what\u2019s already been happening. It\u2019s like the job: yeah, I was working there, but once I was let go, it all made sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">This, even more, in the sense that I\u2019m so done with\u2014even when I realized, this week, is that what\u2019s happened is I\u2019ve changed so much that unfortunately, as comfortable as I am, as much as I love my apartment, I can\u2019t keep living there now.  It\u2019s like I\u2019ve left my mom and all these dumbasses in the dust. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">Being right there is not working for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">Now I\u2019m not even interested in engaging them, even really arguing. When I do argue, it\u2019s very fast, because I tell them right to their face. It\u2019s not like before, when I can\u2019t express myself and I get angry. I still get angry, but now I just articulate it better and very directly. Who cares?  What am I doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Did something come up (inaudible at 00:02:07)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s the normal stuff. Now it feels like, \u201cWhat am I arguing about?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">My grandmother, that whole\u2026 I\u2019m so done. That\u2019s just a bad\u2014it\u2019s like a fucking Eugene O\u2019Neill play, now. It\u2019s bad. My uncle is being so weird, so weird. He refuses to put her in a nursing home. My other aunt, now, is basically living with her. That aunt is already a little bit \u2013 like I\u2019ve said, she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">not like my mom in that way. That\u2019s not a good combo. That is not a good combo. It\u2019s not good for my grandmother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">I\u2019m done. In my mind, my grandmother is\u2014I\u2019ve already let her go.  I savor whatever time. Now I realize it\u2019s a physical thing. I love her. Yeah, she recognizes me. Now it\u2019s all just bonus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">That and everything; I\u2019m done. Because I\u2019m in this mode where I don\u2019t apologize anymore for anything, I\u2019m not going to apologize. When my mom says something \u2013 one of her weird little jabs or whatever \u2013 I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I\u2019m not going to feel bad. If that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019m wasting\u2014it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">not going to work to live there. That\u2019s one little\u2014it\u2019s little but important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">It\u2019s very symbolic. It was already that way, before this Assyria thing happened.  Now it feels like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re done with your family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, I really am. I\u2019m really done, I\u2019m really done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">Today, again, I got a new plow guy. I hurt my hand plowing on Saturday. All these years, I\u2019ve never hurt myself, but it was so heavy and so icy. I got a new plow guy today. I call my mom. She answered the phone like she\u2019s just fought\u2014she\u2019s out of breath, she sounds miserable and fucking angry, sad\u2014everything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">It\u2019s like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m having an okay day, I\u2019m doing my best, I don\u2019t need this shit anymore.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">That\u2019s a little thing, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s so symbolic of the way they are. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561588\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">Yeah, I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done with not being understood, having to explain every-fucking-thing, or having to feel shitty. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">On top of how awesome this has been, I even got a little sign out in the waiting room last week. Last week, right before you let me in, I was taking a picture; I don\u2019t know if you noticed or not. For whatever reason, I don\u2019t read the magazines. I generally sit there and think or play with my phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">But I looked over to the magazines and in the stack \u2013 I don\u2019t even know what magazine it was, because I didn\u2019t have time \u2013 I saw the spines. And on the spine, all there was was a quote. It said, \u201cWhen nothing is sure, everything is possible.\u201d I was quickly taking the picture and my (inaudible at 00:06:01), <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">\u201cOh, that\u2019s a cool picture.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">Took the picture, forgot about it. Then today, I was like, \u201cOh, wait, there\u2019s that awesome picture.\u201d As I was putting it up on Facebook, I was like, \u201cWhat is that quote?\u201d It\u2019s kind of cheesy, but it\u2019s a good quote.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">It\u2019s Margaret Drabble. Margaret Drabble is a British writer who\u2019s pretty well known. Coincidentally, my poems were in an anniversary issue of a magazine with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Huh! (laughs) That\u2019s funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Not trying to read into it, but that says it all, a little bit. It just made me\u2014on a number of levels, like symbolically. But also, it was like this woman is important enough that they\u2019ve taken a quote of hers and put it on a binder of some kind of journal or magazine that you guys keep out <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">here, and my poems are in a magazine with her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">That\u2019s maybe a little thing that doesn\u2019t matter to other people, but I really don\u2019t give a fuck. That matters to me. I don\u2019t have time for this crap anymore. I really, really don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like it becomes, as you read that quote, as you find it\u2019s her, it becomes more real and a little more integrated, that you\u2019re a writer, that you published a book of poems, that you (inaudible at 00:07:34) book of poems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">There\u2019s a way\u2014we were talking, the last couple weeks, about how it felt like somehow, some way, you willed yourself into these things but it hasn\u2019t really been integrated \u2013 your talents or perseverance along the lines of those talents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">There\u2019s a way that sounds like it becomes it just is. That happened. That\u2019s you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: I looked for the magazine.  I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, there it is on Amazon with my name on it and everything.\u201d Come on. What the fuck is happening here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Why doesn\u2019t that get in here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s still going to take a while. I think things are going to progress very quickly when I get the fuck out of here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">The only reason I think it hasn\u2019t integrated more is because I leave here, and then I\u2019m right\u2014if I leave here, I feel good, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m working at this stuff.\u201d But then, I have to deal with this shit. I think every day I make progress, and then I have to go back a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">So I am moving forward, but in a stutter-step kind of way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re surrounded by (crosstalk at 00:08:55)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m surrounded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not even just tying up a past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s in your life right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">The funny thing is I\u2019m not even that worried, now, about money. I\u2019m like, \u201cYou know what? I just need to get to Assyria.\u201d I have places to stay. I\u2019m only going to buy a one-way ticket \u2013 or even a two-way ticket, they\u2019re so cheap in the off-season. I know I have a job, definitely, in the fall. I\u2019m probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">going to teach over the summer, in the summer program.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561588\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">So, really, what does that mean? I need to either make do living with a friend from March to April or whatever, or I\u2019ll find something else while I\u2019m there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">Everyone I\u2019ve talked to, they\u2019re like, \u201cDude, honestly, you need to be here. There\u2019s so much going on. Someone like you? You\u2019re going to thrive.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">My one friend put it a good way, he\u2019s like, \u201cI think we don\u2019t get the statistics of the situation. You\u2019re going to go there and you\u2019re immediately going to be one of maybe 50 or less really, really talented people in the country. Not in the city, in the country. On the one hand, that\u2019s sad. On the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">hand, you\u2019re going to thrive. It\u2019s not like here, where you\u2019re a dime a dozen.\u201d Things like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s as if that\u2019s a whole other family, because it\u2019s Assyrian. It\u2019s not like going to the UK or Europe. There\u2019s a crowd there of Assyrians who totally get it and support and are excited for me to be there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: People you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah, people I know, and even people I\u2019m meeting on Facebook. The people I know, definitely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">It\u2019s sad. In terms of my family, it really is like\u2014I\u2019m not even running away from anything. I love it here, but I cannot afford a decent\u2014it\u2019s just not happening.  Because I\u2019m being principled about what I will do and won\u2019t do and this and that, I can\u2019t live here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:12:14) even asked you last week, what if you got (crosstalk at 00:12:18)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Even if I could, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: You still were feeling like you still would want to go to Assyria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: I would still go. I think this is the time to give it a shot. I\u2019m not going to do it when I\u2019m 55. I mean, I might. I\u2019m young.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">I feel like things are happening. I\u2019ve been writing a lot of songs. Things are percolating.

Even the writers I meet, there\u2019s something \u2013 I can\u2019t put my finger on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">I\u2019m sure in San Diego, maybe it would be a little different, or Halifax something. There\u2019s a hot-blooded\u2014it\u2019s Darien.  There\u2019s no real Bohemian\u2014other than these Assyrian friends of mine, who somehow just refuse to not be the way they are; refuse to conform, basically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">They conform enough, because we all have to. They get it. It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, of course, I need to make money. So I\u2019ll start a diner or I\u2019ll be a jeweler,\u201d but they don\u2019t give a fuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">Whereas for my mom\u2019s family, then it\u2019s the opposite. If you\u2019re a jeweler, it\u2019s all about that: being the best jeweler, being a rich jeweler, all that shit. All that other stuff is tacked onto that. \u201cHe has a summer home in Assyria, every summer they go and they\u2014\u201d You know, that doesn\u2019t mean shit. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201171\">all part and parcel of this rat race that they\u2019re in. My uncle has a palatial Cape Cod home that I think only stresses him out.  I see no positive consequences of that fucking house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">Everything\u2019s the opposite. (laughs) \u201cBuying a huge house.\u201d Great, well, now you have two years of a seemingly endless nightmare of renovations and zoning meetings and weird, WASP-y, bitchy neighbors. For what? For what? You already have a McMansion. It\u2019s madness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">Assyria is more of these other types of people. They\u2019re like, \u201cWhat? Yeah, of course we need money. No shit.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">THERAPIST: But not for financial prestige, it\u2019s (crosstalk at 00:32:56)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">CLIENT: These things are a given.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: Not for some people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">CLIENT: What I\u2019m saying is here, there\u2019s this idea that artist this, that. That somehow, we\u2019re lazy or we don\u2019t get it or we don\u2019t work hard. What they don\u2019t understand is for us, there\u2019s nothing to talk about regarding money. No fucking shit, of course you need money. Their logic is so weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">The question is, is that all you want? That\u2019s the question. No shit, we have to work. Why have I been working? Why have I been striving all these years?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">That\u2019s what annoys me. Say something I don\u2019t know. Say something a little more nuanced. Basically, all you\u2019re saying is wear yourself down to the nubs and just make money. Mother of God, whatever the fuck you do, and then just die. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20128-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20128-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561588\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">You\u2019re going to enjoy that money when, what, you\u2019re 80?

Clearly, this is just the way he is. His wife is clearly the way she. Really, these spoiled <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B1\">brats are going to have this wealth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">So now you tell me: who\u2019s happier, me or my uncle?

I love it here. This is the greatest town. I mean, I\u2019m from here. We\u2019re in such a cozy little bubble here: everything\u2019s clean and quaint and even our fucking urbanized, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201531\">shitty areas are really not shitty.

You\u2019re going to thrive there.\u201d That makes me really excited, because they\u2019re all such different people.
