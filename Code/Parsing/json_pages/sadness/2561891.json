I know we\u2019ve kind of scheduled some extra sessions lately. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Well I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just like starting to get worried about the cost of stuff, so. Let me think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Well, if you want to plan on skipping it and see how you\u2019re doing next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: And if you feel like you need to schedule an interim schedule, we can kind of find a space on either the Friday before or the week after.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Okay. That works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Okay. How are you doing this week?

Sort of\u2026like I was doing fine yesterday and then today I had like a freak out again. And I was just like, you know, because there seems like there\u2019s nowhere to do work in my apartment and there\u2019s nowhere nearby my apartment to go to do work, which might not actually be true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: You just don\u2019t know the area well enough yet, or\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean like I guess there\u2019s the Panera, which, you know, not going to walk in and listen at like the\u2026with the laptop in my backpack. Like it\u2019s just, I was like I should be applying for things, but I haven\u2019t applied for anything. It did, even on Tara.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: And so it turns out she\u2019s actually unemployed right now too, though, she\u2019s out in Branbury. So like she suggested one list that I should get myself on that they like list jobs every Friday. So. But.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: That might turn out to be a useful tip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: So you were able to e-mail her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">[01:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: And you weren\u2019t able to post\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I just [inaudible \u2013 01:57].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: \u2026the resume to anything else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: And I decided not to e-mail the person. Like I just don\u2019t know that I want to go back to volunteering at the Pawtucket Historical Society. I feel like if I am going to volunteer somewhere, I should try to find a new place. I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: How come? What\u2019s more\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: For a different experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Maybe not, and I guess I also like half the fun of being at the Historical Society was like being able to hang out with Tara and stuff. And you know, that\u2019s all fun. And it would be more serious. Which is fine considering, like, you know. I guess also it could be a lot more, like I wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F1\">really have any sort of like archivist supervision or like I\u2019d have to be figuring out everything for myself for like, you know, which would be fine if it were a real job. But like if I\u2019m going to be volunteering, I want to like, I don\u2019t know; I can\u2019t really articulate it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">[03:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">But I guess if I wanted to go back somewhere else I could go back, possibly. It said the divinity school library. So that will end up looking very very weird on my resume because it\u2019ll have like, you know, summer 2009 to 2010. And late 2010, 2011 summer. And then, you know, three years later, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: Is that an option?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561891\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I thought it is. I mean I\u2019d probably only be doing about four hours a week because that\u2019s what I did last time. I\u2019m pretty sure they don\u2019t have\u2026and I could see if they\u2019re\u2026because I doubt they\u2019re looking for someone paid right now. But I bet I could volunteer there again. Like they <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">liked me. They liked the work I did. And I\u2019m on good terms with them. The only reason why I left was school. So, I\u2019m pretty sure I could go back to volunteering there if I wanted to because I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well, even though it\u2019s separated in time, it might be nice to see that sort of continuity on your resume. Because it\u2019s\u2026I mean I think if you\u2019re not employed by the time your time at the museum ends, then having something to do that feels productive and keeps you in contact with people is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">really important both, primarily, for your mental health. It doesn\u2019t make you feel good to not have any structure to your day or week. So having something in place like that just to give you some structure, sometimes, would be beneficial to you independent of any job connections or anything that might also bring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">[05:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: True. Yeah. And I wouldn\u2019t be that far away. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: No. That\u2019s a pretty good commute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. If it were nice then I could even walk it. Not, if it\u2019s going to be like weather like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: In March it won\u2019t be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Well, March, can go either way, so. Yeah. I\u2019ll let you know, though, if they would want me to come back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: So I know you started by saying yesterday you were okay and today you started freaking out again. What was the difference between yesterday and today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yesterday I had lots of things to do and stuff, maybe. Today I was feeling trapped. Like yesterday we went out to the [inaudible \u2013 05:49] for lunch and then like there was a Super Bowl party in the evening. But today, I just freaked out. [Tearful] I just can\u2019t. Like I don\u2019t think I can handle <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">those boxes by myself. It\u2019s like every time I try it\u2019s really scary. Like if Sydney says he\u2019ll help me, but I have to wait for him. So I do feel out of control. And like sort of trapped in there by the table and like\u2026like I shouldn\u2019t have let my parents bring up the table because now it just makes everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200692\">worse because, like we cleared out some of the boxes, there are still like a good like 10, 15 boxes that are still there. And they\u2019re just in the way. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to get them out of the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">[06:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">And, you know, I got the, like the electrician came to do the outlet, but I still have to wait until tomorrow for them to do the sink and the toilet and the sink is driving me insane, just having it like constantly dripping. And like, you know, it won\u2019t stop. I can\u2019t get it to stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: No, you need the plumber to come fix it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s on order.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. I had no clue until like I finally asked today because like he never told me that he was sending like anyone else out in the first place. And then like, you know, I wasn\u2019t sure if they were all going to be together at different times. So I guess he\u2019ll be coming by some time tomorrow. [Tearful] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">But I just don\u2019t want to live with, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m just thinking, you know, like even if I do find something, like it\u2019ll probably, like things that I\u2019m seeing a lot of them are like, you know, part-time no benefits. Or a lot them are part-time, pro-rated benefits. But like, you know, maybe I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200752\">am better off moving back with my parents in Connecticut and working at the store. And I mean I\u2019ll be miserable, but at least I\u2019ll be employed.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561891\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">[08:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">And then, you know, when my parents retire, I could own the store and then I\u2019d be making a decent income and I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about supporting myself because I\u2019d have something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: When are your parents planning on retiring?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: I think, at this point, in the next five years. So pretty soon. Like they\u2019re in their 60\u2019s. Originally I thought they were going to retire when they were like, would be eligible for Social Security. So but pretty soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: So is that a realistic option for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Possibly, I mean, I can. But I think it might be\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: That doesn\u2019t sound very promising.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Well, neither does working for like, you know, maybe I\u2019ll be lucky if I find a job that gives me $40,000 a year. Maybe. I\u2019ll probably be working for a lot less than that and like, if I\u2019m even working at all. You know, like say, volunteering in my field doesn\u2019t really seem that realistic either <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">I don\u2019t know. I mean. It\u2019s possible I could like live at home, like work in the store part-time and like maybe volunteer at an zoo like at Columbia or something like that part-time. But like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">[09:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Have you, have you been looking at jobs, also, in surrounding your parents area as an option of maybe living there and working in your field?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Not yet. I should.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: I wonder if that might be a better next step than abandoning your intended career to work at their store. You\u2019ve never shown an interest, in here, of actually working at their store.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: No. I mean I actually like the\u2026like the job that my mom does, like if she weren\u2019t doing it, like that I\u2019d be probably doing it. I like all the financial stuff. The cashing up and payroll\u2026well, I guess I\u2019ve never done payroll. Really. Like that kind of thing. It\u2019s just the standing up and the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">customers and the retail part is the part that I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: The customer facing part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean like things have changed a lot and now they have like an up to date system. When I was working there in high school, they didn\u2019t. And so it was like pretty miserable to like do special orders and all that and, you know, and I was like if I were working at like The Gap or something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">then I would have just been like ringing things up and everything would have had bar codes on it and stuff. So like I sort of resented the haphazard nature of some of the stuff in the store that like, you know, it wasn\u2019t all in the system and, you know, if I screwed up, then I couldn\u2019t just\u2026I had to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200952\">like have someone else come to fix it. Like I didn\u2019t actually have the authority to fix it myself because someone had used like the total void to steal money from the store. So they took it away from everyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">[11:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">I actually could have done it on my own, but like because I had my dad\u2019s account and I knew his password, because he had like told it to me before. But like since the protocol was that I wasn\u2019t supposed to use total void, I would have to like call someone down so as not to like, you know, if another, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">didn\u2019t want to like bring up trouble if there was a second cashier, I\u2019d be like, oh, look, I can do total void and you can\u2019t. So, and because that\u2019s what they told me to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561891\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">So I was miserable when I was working there in high school. And I\u2019m sure\u2026I guess it would still be miserable if I worked. I guess the other problem is if I were a cashier, then they\u2019d be paying me like maybe if I\u2019m lucky, they\u2019d be paying me $10 an hour. But I guess if I were living at home, it wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">matter because then I wouldn\u2019t really need money for anything except spending money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Well, focusing on, you know, kind of the present, what do you want your goals to be for yourself? Is it just to survive? Is it\u2026what\u2019s the goal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: [Tearful] Well, like part of the fear is also like this is freaking me out too, is like I\u2019m so afraid now that because I was like, you know, they did the test that I\u2019m pre-diabetic. I\u2019m like so afraid I\u2019m going to get diabetes. And if I were at home, at least, you know, I\u2019d be eating salad on <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">a regular basis and stuff. And I, you know, would have healthy food there that I wouldn\u2019t have to like go to the grocery store for, and I wouldn\u2019t have to, you know, like whereas here I have to get over that hump of like going there and sometimes I don\u2019t feel well, like you know. If I get takeout or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F2\">something, then that\u2019s pushing me further and further and I\u2019m so afraid I\u2019m going to get diabetes. And I\u2019m like [inaudible\/crying \u2013 12:58] going to happen because I don\u2019t know what else to do because I don\u2019t have the self-control to just like go to the grocery store and do all the things that I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F3\">to do on a regular basis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">[13:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">Like sometimes I\u2019ll go to the grocery store when I\u2019m feeling up for it, but it\u2019s not a guarantee that I always will. And I get so afraid and the way that [inaudible \u2013 13:25] eats and like, you know, he wants to eat out less, but we haven\u2019t really been doing much eating out. Like it\u2019s just so unhealthy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">And I need to get to lose weight. And I\u2019m just so afraid that I\u2019m not going to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you need your parents to be in charge of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Well, I feel like I need someone else to be buying groceries. Like, you know, when I was at the old place, I didn\u2019t have to buy groceries because Aimee would buy the groceries. But now I have to buy the groceries myself. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m always capable of doing that, you know. I usually, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">I often will go for these. And also having the tiny kitchen that I feel like I can\u2019t cook in. Even today, like, if we were having meat, like I was having a sandwich and I was going to have a salad with it, and I needed a fork and getting a fork required getting this giant box of silverware out because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A72\">that\u2019s where the meat silverware is. And so then like Sydney got the box out for me. But then it was on the table and like I had no space to like actually make anything. It was just like really cramped and uncomfortable and like having an actual kitchen that like had space in it would make it easier, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">[14:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: So it sounds like part of the difficulty in cooking in your kitchen is that there are still boxes in the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Well that wasn\u2019t\u2026that\u2019s the box is supposed to be there. That\u2019s like the container for the meat silverware. But it\u2019s big and heavy. But then to get back on the shelf, like I wasn\u2019t going to be able to do that by myself, so I didn\u2019t even try. But Sydney was already back in the other room and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">was busy and we were\u2026kind of got in to a fight\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561891\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: See, that sounds like a really difficult situation. If you\u2019re not able to access your silverware by yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Well, the meat somewhere and the dairy is somewhere. I can access by myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s a\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: But the table is in the way. Like we got the boxes are in the room. Like if I put, like, you know, put the table against the wall or something, like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: That would give space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t do that yet. So yeah, it feels like I can\u2019t really do anything. And then I [inaudible \u2013 15:36] like, you know, there are tons of, I have all these groceries that like, you know, all the ones that were in the fridge are in the fridge. But all the ones that were dry like are in bags on <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">the table because I don\u2019t have a place to put them. So like I really don\u2019t have the space to like be able to easily like make healthy food and eat it. And therefore, I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m going to just keep on, you know, and like with Sydney, it\u2019s not healthy eating habits too. Like, I\u2019m just so screwed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B92\">if I stay here. Like, you know, my parents, like food, like there will be dinner and it might not be that good, but like, because I\u2019m a better cook than my mom, because I think, there will always be dinner and there will always be salad at dinner and you know, even if the food is heavy, I can eat less <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B93\">of it. I\u2019m eating more meat and stuff there and less, just, you know, a la carte ever. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">[16:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">I just don\u2019t want to get diabetes and I\u2019m scared out of my mind. And I think I feel like the only way to do that right now, like, \u2018cause I don\u2019t think I can move in to a different place, like, at least until August. So I feel like the only way I can do that is to go home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a very big leap. It\u2019s a very big decision to make based on that fear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s a really scary fear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yes, it is. I think I\u2019m not at all minimizing your fear about developing diabetes. I understand why that\u2019s so scary and that that is a real possibility if your health continues in the same path. The tunnel vision that you see only one option to avoid that feels unrealistic to me. That, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">is one option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Like I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t see myself making it work in the apartment. It\u2019s too small. Like the kitchen is too small. [Crying.] Everything is too small. And I don\u2019t see a way for myself to like be constantly eating healthy there. And maybe if I only bought vegetables that like didn\u2019t require preparation <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">or something, that I could just eat whole, maybe that would help. It must be something. If I had cucumbers or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Well, I think there are lots of\u2026the sort of direct connection you\u2019re making between the space difficulties and what you can do in them feels limited to me or maybe it\u2019s the combination of yes; it might be more difficult, but picking up and moving is also really a big hassle. So what makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C71\">it seem easier to you to uproot your entire life and move to your parent\u2019s house than to prepare a salad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Because one you have to do on a regular basis over and over again and there\u2019s space. The other one you do once and then it\u2019s done.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561891\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Ah. Yeah. So it\u2019s not wanting to make a lifestyle change. And for some reason, not seeing as picking up and moving into your parent\u2019s house as a lifestyle change. That would be a big lifestyle change to move in and live with your parents again. To give up that independence that you fought <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">pretty hard for a couple of years back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">[19:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: But I feel like I\u2019m wasting all their money, especially now that my job is ending in March and not in like June. [Tearful.] I don\u2019t want to waste all their money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: If you move out of your apartment, are you allowed to not pay your rent? Or is that like\u2026can you break\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: Breaking the lease would be less expensive than like seven more months of rent. Or I guess I paid February\u2019s, so six more months of rent. I have to look at the lease and see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That might be sort of a real life consideration to see what would happen if you broke your lease; if he would allow you to break your lease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I have no idea. I\u2019ll look at it. Or maybe I could sublet it or something. Even if I didn\u2019t get all the months of it, it would still be, you know, even if I got like five months or whatever, that would still be like saving my parents money. I mean I don\u2019t know; it\u2019s probably not realistic <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D71\">for me to move back, but I\u2019m just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019re very focused on that as a solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">[20:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: I just can\u2019t deal with like the tiny kitchen and like living here and being far away from everyone and I feel so isolated. I don\u2019t have any friends anymore. [Crying.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Would that be different in Connecticut?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">[20:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Well, at least then I\u2019ll have my cat. I guess the place is in no shape for me to bring [inaudible \u2013 20:48] back with me. I have to wait until March anyways because my parents, like, are going to Jordan and I have to cat sit for them, or house sit, well really cat sit because they ended up taking <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E31\">in like, I thought they were going to time it so they wouldn\u2019t have any foster cats while they were in Jordan, but they ended up taking in a pregnant mother who like, hasn\u2019t given birth yet. So like the kittens will still be like in their care by the time they\u2019re in Jordan. So I have to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: When is this trip?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: It\u2019s\u2026I think they leave on March 18th, I think. You know, it\u2019s a Tuesday. So that\u2019s when they leave. That\u2019s right after my [inaudible \u2013 21:34]. So originally, you know, it\u2019s going to be like, oh, well, I\u2019ll have like a short commute for those days. And now I\u2019ll have no commute because I won\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">have the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: What would your plan with Sydney be if you moved to your parents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean we might have to break up. I guess he wouldn\u2019t want to be coming over all the time and, I mean, we can see each other less often. But I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m just, I mean we\u2019re driving each other crazy right now because he won\u2019t\u2026he refuses to like believe me that like this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB1\">apartment is a problem. And just tells me to calm down and I tell him\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">[22:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: So he doesn\u2019t see it as a problem or\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: He thinks like he\u2026yeah, he doesn\u2019t. He thinks it\u2019s all workable, but I\u2019m like, you know, you\u2019re not the one trying to live in it. I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: So what is he\u2019s seeing that\u2019s different than what you see?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200F2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561891\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: I have no idea because he doesn\u2019t see a small kitchen as an issue. But there are all the boxes in the way so I really have no room to maneuver or to put food or to do anything. I guess he thinks moving stuff around is fine or like we can eat take out all the time is fine or something. Like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F51\">don\u2019t know what. But like, you know, we got in a fight today and I\u2019m driving him crazy. And like this might also bring us down the road to breaking up too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: What was the argument today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: Me freaking out about the house and him telling me not to freak out and eventually I was starting get in to it because I was getting really annoyed at him and there were some things said, so. He eventually sort of like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Who called names?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: I called himself righteous and stuff because I thought he was sort of like telling me that I was wrong and he was right and, like, oh clearly the apartment isn\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s you. Like he never said that, but like it seems like he was implying that. So, [inaudible \u2013 23:54] and ended up <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD1\">yelling at me and like freaking out. And then I was just so\u2026I need to get out of this apartment somehow and I don\u2019t know how and I can\u2019t do it for another seven months. I can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">[24:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: You definitely need to get out of this cycle; this cycle of feeling that there is, you know, so much that\u2019s out of your control and continually looking for the one thing that will solve all these problems. And getting out of the cycle might mean getting out of the apartment and being in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201011\">place where your parents or someone else takes on some that responsibility for daily life tasks because it sounds like they feel really overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: They are and I just don\u2019t trust myself to take care of myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: Another way of getting out of the cycle is to start doing some of that stuff so that it doesn\u2019t feel so trapped. I mean it sounds like\u2026yesterday you said was a much better day because you were busy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: But I wasn\u2019t doing anything after like sustaining self, going to the grocery store; things that I\u2019m supposed to be doing. Like I was just avoiding everything. You know, I don\u2019t know how that solves the problem. And like I\u2019m just afraid the\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: Avoiding things don\u2019t solve the problem. But using the energy that you use to e-mail Tara, to go to the Superbowl party, you have that energy and that can be used sometimes for social things and sometimes for managing daily life. But it sounds like today you didn\u2019t use the energy to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: Well, I e-mailed Tara today, but that was because it was a really small simple task.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: But an important one. What else did you use your energy for today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t put together the bills for my gas and electric and sent those out. Like the tax [inaudible \u2013 26:06].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: Okay. An important task to do, to take care of your finances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. That was\u2026and I e-mailed the landlord asking about when he was going to send out the plumber for the sink and the toilet and God, there are lots of other. But like I just feel so trapped in there. It\u2019s sort of like where\u2019s to write any cover letters or do anything like that? Like I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201131\">a place to escape to or something like\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">[26:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t really take that much space to write an e-mail, so I wonder what felt\u2026because obviously you wrote the e-mail to Tara\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20116-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20116-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561891\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">CLIENT: It\u2019s an e-mail; it\u2019s not a cover letter.

Like I need to go to another room because there\u2019s no other room to go to. With the old place, like I never wrote cover letters <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F1\">in my room. I would usually like go to the TV room or go to the living room or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: What makes a different room better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: Well, just because I\u2019m used to like, oh, this is the room that I\u2019m Interneting and goofing off and not getting any work done. And then, oh, going to a different place, oh; it feels like more, oh, I should get more work done because I\u2019m this different place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: And ideally, that helps having sort of a separation from your work space and your play space. So that would be ideal, but it sounds like it\u2019s not possible. So\u2026and it\u2019s also not necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">CLIENT: I think it is necessary. I really, really do. You know, if I could\u2026maybe it would just require taking the bus and going to the Square and going to one of the coffee shops here or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">THERAPIST: You can do that for sure. You have the subway. You may have places you could even walk to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">[28:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">CLIENT: Not in this snow. I really don\u2019t want to walk in the snow. But, you know, if I could make myself do that one day a week, like, I mean yesterday I was busy, but if I could do that like normally; like if I use some days for that, then maybe I might have a chance of just\u2026I\u2019m so afraid not everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D1\">will, you know. I\u2019m just losing control of everything. Like I really think that I can\u2019t take care of myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re certainly\u2026you\u2019re not taking care of yourself right now. I think that is\u2026the reality is that you aren\u2019t taking care of yourself right now. And I don\u2019t think you have been for quite some time. In the way that you describe how often you\u2019re getting yourself fresh food and, you know, sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">of how long it\u2019s taking to unpack some boxes. You know, I think you\u2019re quite right in that you\u2019re not taking good care of yourself. That doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t, but it does mean that you\u2019re choosing not to right now. And figuring out what you can choose to do, which things you can\u2019t, and what to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F2\">do for the things that you feel you really can\u2019t do, what to do instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">CLIENT: Well, [inaudible \u2013 29:52] that actually believe that I can\u2019t take care of myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">THERAPIST: I just said that I, you aren\u2019t. I\u2019m agreeing with you that you\u2019re not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">CLIENT: No, you\u2019re saying I\u2019m not. You\u2019re saying I\u2019m choosing not to. That\u2019s different than can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">THERAPIST: I guess it would take evidence that you\u2019re never able to do those things vs. the pattern that I\u2019m seeing is a lot of fear and anxiety around doing those things. But a history of being able to accomplish tasks. I see there are a lot of times you\u2019re successful in doing something that you didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201371\">believe you could do. I don\u2019t want you to sell yourself short. And I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s not an okay path to go move in with your parents. But I think that we do need to see that that would have benefits and costs. And I don\u2019t want you to take on a cost that might be bigger than the benefit you get. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201372\">I don\u2019t know what the value, because it\u2019s sort of how that weighs out. I ask questions so that you evaluate both sides and that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s problematic when you only see one choice. Because that doesn\u2019t allow you to evaluate, maybe, some of the other choices or do a balanced evaluation of what <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201373\">that particular choice is.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20136-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20136-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561891\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">[31:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: I see the other choices as staying and not taking care of myself.

Like, you know, when I go to work every time, like I thought, like, oh, going to the grocery store won\u2019t be so bad going after work. But by the time I get home from work, I\u2019m just, you know, after that drive, I\u2019m just so dead, it\u2019s like, you know, shaking and don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F1\">want to drive anymore. I don\u2019t want to do anything else, and then I can\u2019t go to the grocery store after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the shaking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: Sometimes like if there\u2019s been lots of traffic or like if I\u2019ve been tired and like been forcing myself to stay awake so I can get home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t know about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: I mean it doesn\u2019t happen every day, but it happened this past week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">THERAPIST: Is this the first time it\u2019s happened this week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s definitely happened this week. I don\u2019t always pay attention to it. It\u2019s usually, I, lately, as of late, I usually, when I come home I\u2019m like shaking or something unless I like leave work really early or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry to hear that. I didn\u2019t know about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I actually, I took it really really calmly when they told me that my grant was ending in March. Part of that was probably relief from not having to deal with that drive anymore, because the drive is just so really horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">[33:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">THERAPIST: Taxing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: It\u2019s so bad. Which is why I really didn\u2019t want to work in Westford either because like, you know\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: It would be the same thing in a different direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it would be slightly less, but it would be pretty bad. So, like I can\u2019t keep doing it. And I won\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">[33:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s, I mean it\u2019s temporary. So I guess that\u2019s another piece of why it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe you that things are really difficult, but right, you know, sort of the light is at the end of the tunnel in terms of the commute. And if that\u2019s part of what\u2019s making it so hard to make other <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D1\">choices that would be adaptive for you, like eating healthier or having a space to exercise more in your day. Any sort of space, time-wise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">THERAPIST: You know, maybe that will\u2026maybe you\u2019ll feel differently then. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">CLIENT: Maybe. Maybe I should just like temporarily stay with my parents a little bit more while I\u2019m finishing the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">THERAPIST: It does really cut down on the commute for you to do that. And that was something that you had mentioned a week or two ago; what about staying with them a couple days a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20164-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20164-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561891\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">CLIENT: It didn\u2019t happen last week because we were originally going to go out\u2026well, we were planning on going out to the north end. It was going to be Wednesday. After we left work early, I want to say, but then Sydney wasn\u2019t feeling well. So we ended up not being able to go then. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">THERAPIST: So maybe this week or next, thinking about giving yourself a temporary reprieve and seeing how that, seeing how having a reduced commute a couple of days impacts you and maybe gives you some energy to devote to something else during the week that impacts you positively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">[34:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">CLIENT: And then I\u2019ll have time to relax before doing something. I could even possibly write job applications in the evening. It\u2019s the commute. It\u2019s so bad. But then like even though I don\u2019t have it on Mondays and Fridays, like I just feel like that rest of the time is sort of making up for all the <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D1\">times I don\u2019t have it in the middle of the week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So I mean it sounds like at the beginning of the session, all of the distress was really related to the space and feeling trapped in your apartment. And now as we\u2019re talking, it sounds like so much of the distress and exhaustion is related to the commute. And I think they\u2019re both probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F1\">stressors, right. They\u2019re both environmental stressors. Not having a space where you feel comfortable is definitely a stressor. Feeling kind of claustrophobic; definitely a stressor. The long commute \u2013 and it sounds like there\u2019s anxiety when you\u2019re driving, especially if there\u2019s traffic \u2013 takes a toll on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">CLIENT: I guess it just seems so natural that I forgot that it wasn\u2019t like, that\u2019s not how everybody feels when they drive. And like usually it\u2019s fine in the morning; it\u2019s the evening one that is a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">THERAPIST: Is the traffic different, or is it that you\u2019re tired at the end of the day? What\u2019s the difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">[36:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">CLIENT: Both, I think. Maybe I should like get a coffee to bring with me on the way back, which, I don\u2019t know if that would be the healthiest choice, but maybe that would fix the problem because yeah, they\u2019re like\u2026and it\u2019s dark. The dark is not helping at all. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20179\">THERAPIST: That kind of makes it harder to drive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think, in the summer it wasn\u2019t that bad because it wasn\u2019t dark out when I was driving. But the darkness just\u2026between the darkness and the traffic at night because usually, the traffic hits when you hit like 93. And the being tired from work. Because usually, like, usually it\u2019s around <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B1\">3:00 o\u2019clock in the afternoon that I start getting tired and bored and antsy when I\u2019m doing my work. So I come off feeling sort of blah, even if like, you know, the very beginning of the day I\u2019m like yay; I get to do work. And like, actually, happy to be there. But you have that like so ready to go home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">THERAPIST: So it seems important to acknowledge these things too in factoring in how you feel in your apartment because the stressors you take with you from being tired at work, the commute, you bring home with you. And those are temporary now. You won\u2019t be carrying those particular things with you <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D1\">six weeks from now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">[38:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20181\">CLIENT: True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20183\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know how much of an impact that might have, but hopefully it will get to be some relief to not have those pieces and I don\u2019t know what, you know, what else will change by then. Maybe a different job; it may not be.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20182-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20182-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561891\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20185\">CLIENT: If I could just get myself out every day and like, you know, when I\u2019m not working. If I could just spend the day like at a coffee shop or maybe on Yale\u2019s campus or something like that. But maybe I should go back, like I don\u2019t know if I could still hang out with them, but like, personally, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201851\">always did like work [inaudible \u2013 38:41]. And then you\u2019re like with other people and then you could get worked on and I would go to those. Maybe go to those to write cover letters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20187\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Having a place where you feel comfortable is really important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yeah, right now I don\u2019t have that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Right now you don\u2019t have that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20191\">CLIENT: That still doesn\u2019t solve the healthy eating problem and with me being so terrified of\u2026 [Tearful.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20193\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t.

That\u2019s\u2026of course you don\u2019t. But let\u2019s separate those pieces. You can\u2019t jump from pre-diabetic to dying of diabetes. There\u2019s a long path there and there are spaces where you can reverse that. So right now, it feels too overwhelming to take some of the steps that you need to take in order <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201A11\">to reverse that. But that\u2019s not, you know, that\u2019s\u2026.there are lots of years there where, hopefully, we can tackle some of these problems so that you can choose to make better choices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A3\">CLIENT: Uh huh.

You\u2019ve got time to try to work on these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N201AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561891\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AF\">[42:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B1\">CLIENT: So if I like be going for a few like until I\u2019m finished up at the zoo, then it won\u2019t be the end of the world?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B3\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think so, but I can\u2019t make those guarantees. But I don\u2019t\u2026it doesn\u2019t feel like you feel capable of making a concerted effort. So it doesn\u2019t really matter if it\u2019s okay. You have to be able to make it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B5\">CLIENT: I can do what I can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B7\">THERAPIST: So well then that\u2019s the best you can do. And I firmly believe, as you feel frustrated by, I believe that you can make these healthier choices. It seems like you feel frustrated by my belief that you can do that. But you, I can\u2019t make them for you. I can\u2019t make you do things. You can only <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201B71\">do what you feel capable of doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B9\">CLIENT: I just feel capable of doing so little.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Then start with the things that you can do. Do the little things you can do. What can you do today after you leave here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BD\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a loaded question. Well, if Sydney actually comes down, like he didn\u2019t come with me if he was going to, he was still planning on doing his session in person and I didn\u2019t bring any sort of like computer or anything with me, so, because I forgot about the whole if he comes down, then I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201BD1\">waiting for another hour for him to finish. So if he brings the laptop, then maybe I can like eval other people or write a cover letter or something, possibly, in the next hour. Otherwise, maybe I can work on the one box that\u2019s in my room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Sounds good. That sounds like a good plan. Thinking about one cover letter or one box. One thing. One thing is manageable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C3\">THERAPIST: So let\u2019s make that the plan for today. If he comes with the computer, then you do one cover letter. If not, you tackle one box and get that piece off your burden.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C5\">CLIENT: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Then I will see you next week at the normal time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C9\">CLIENT: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CB\">[END OF AUDIO.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CD\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
