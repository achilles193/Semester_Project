So I\u2019m... then I didn\u2019t have anything to say, but I guess I want to say thank you, that I appreciated you talking about it. It... It took me a few minutes, after I left, to sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">of sort out my feelings, but... I was very grateful for you, to you for talking about it. Just... it was, it was interesting, and also comforting, and sort of reassuring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">Like, you were saying that... not only is it essentially okay that I interact with the world in a particular fashion, but it is necessary that we construct theories to make sense of our reality. (therapist responds) (pause) I also felt like you were sort of... I don\u2019t want to say \u201ccasually dismissive\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">of like, particular strains of theory... and... I like that in anyone who is an expert at something. It\u2019s nice, because it sort of... I mean, I get bogged down and sort of questioning everything. That\u2019s not always necessary. That\u2019s nice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: When you say \u201ccasually dismissive\u201d of...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I, so, you sort of said that, you know, that psychotherapy gets a bad rap, and deservedly so, for focusing too much on \u201ceverything comes from your childhood.\u201d Then you sort of developed a \u201csecond order of theory\u201d of... it\u2019s important, but it\u2019s important because of the way you construct, one <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">constructs theories about how one exists, and continues to do so through time. So, but... you know, that sort of \u201ccasually dismissive\u201d of that strain of theory, of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Oh, not even casually. (both chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Sorry, I meant off-handedly...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Taken.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: But (chuckles) ... fair enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Well, there is certainly that construct. For some people, make (ph), is very meaningful. But I\u2019m less interested in the specific structure of it, but the fact that the structure is important, that (client chuckles) the importance of having a structure, not the particular kind of structure. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">Being wedded to a particular kind of structure, I think, is problematic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: (chuckles) I... I\u2019m not at all surprised to hear you say that (therapist responds), but... It\u2019s sort of like... we\u2019ve been doing this for a long time, and it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t talked about what we\u2019re doing, but you\u2019re also providing in some ways more details here than you have at other times, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">or it makes more sense in these last two discussions. (therapist responds) It\u2019s also nice because I feel like you, you\u2019re talking about what you do and it\u2019s important to you. I find that interesting, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Well, and I\u2019m sharing with you how I think about things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. Thank you for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: And that I have reasons and so in some ways, I have very clear ideas about how I think about things. It\u2019s not random.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: (affirms) (pause) What was that last part? You said... it\u2019s not random. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: That it\u2019s not, that I have, that not only am I sharing it, but that you\u2019re sort of, you\u2019re seeing that there are certain... sort of areas that I have very clear ideas about. Like, it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about and developed, it\u2019s not random or like, maybe this or maybe that. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">(client affirms) (pause) No, I want to know what you\u2019re thinking, but I think maybe I even, if I\u2019m thinking about why I even said that, I, about, well, I think that, you know, knowing you, that that is something that you appreciate, when there is sort a lot of forethought into how... someone goes about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200352\">doing something. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562678\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yes. You\u2019re very purposive in what you do. (therapist affirms) And that, in some ways, that has been very clear. So you\u2019re sort of saying, \u201cYes of course, and it\u2019s in this particular fashion.\u201d Yeah, I mean, that\u2019s also reassuring. But... I guess I was sort of sitting here, wondering why you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">would say that, but you\u2019ve just answered. But I\u2019m also... wondering whether I have like... suggested to you that I think what you do is random, because I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t that\u2019s how I think about it, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: No. I don\u2019t think that way, either, but I was just, the thought that came to my mind was (maybe this could be more generalized), but certainly, you know, when Tanya, when she was sort of in and out of the hospital and you were sort of meeting with people and you thought, \u201cDo they actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d (client chuckles) It was very scary and enraging at times. Do they actually know, do they have an idea of what they were talking about? (client affirms) (pause) Maybe more generally like, this concern like, \u201cDo the people in charge know what they\u2019re doing?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And... In many circumstances, the answer is \u201csort of.\u201d (therapist affirms) I know you sort of, you\u2019ve pushed on that idea before, in suggesting that I... perhaps undervalue the extent to which the people who are doing things are doing them for a reason. That might be true. But... So in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">that instance, another thing that I found very frustrating about it was that everyone sort of goes through the same sequence when they meet Tanya. So it was like... they hear her story and they... seem to start constructing essentially a similar sequence of theories, as if... while hearing the history, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">in which she is talking about seeing a whole bunch of other people who do their job, they aren\u2019t recognizing that the other people will have constructed the same theories, and that their first conclusion has probably already been tried. That sort of, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">(pause) It\u2019s sort of like... you know, you were giving, in many ways, a very complex level of theory and... to... you know, it\u2019s, I guess... it\u2019s simple, in that it\u2019s... It can be expressed simply, but it\u2019s also... (inaudible) ... yeah, I guess I feel like, at the... as I understood what you were saying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">you would say something like, \u201cWell, obviously these things that have happened in Tanya\u2019s life are important, but at least as important is how she has responded to them, and the sort of responses she has constructed internally in the narrative, she has constructed internally to explain what is going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">on in her life. (pause) Maybe everyone in your discipline feels the same way, or believes the same things, or... I don\u2019t even feel so many things (ph), um... but that\u2019s not at all clear, so, yeah...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562678\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">(pause 00:11:12 to 00:11:43)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">But this is also related to... trust more generally. There is a... There is a sense in which I seem to look for... probably some specific markers (but I don\u2019t know that I could articulate what all of them are) that indicate that there is forethought into what\u2019s going on and that... an understanding <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">of... both what\u2019s being done and the effects that it\u2019s having, because... most organizations have a structure, and most structures do something to the people in them, and that does something to the final product, also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: (pause) Well, and you\u2019re acutely aware that all organizations, I was going to say most, but all organizations are so far from perfect. And that difference between how you feel they ought to run and how they actually run is disappointing. I think sometimes you\u2019re not sure what to do with that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">disappointment like, whether you should trust them at all, then. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, and that disappointment is related to this... you suggested I have a tendency to despair. (therapist affirms) This... Go ahead. You agreed like you were going to say something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Well, that abol , that the disappointment slides into that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, I that\u2019s right. And so, you know, I\u2019ve been working on it. Describing that as a thing that happens is, has been helpful and also you... we spend a lot of time talking about things could be non-ideal and still okay, and still even good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">(pause 00:13:46 to 00:14:33)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">Yeah, I think in a general sense, it seems helpful to... have the non-ideality be acknowledged. (pause) But there are unhelpful ways of doing that. People will say things like, \u201cWell, nothing is perfect.\u201d That\u2019s true, but that\u2019s... you know, that\u2019s the... if my... view of things is non-ideal, and therefore <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">bad, it\u2019s na\u00efve (and it is), then the converse is also na\u00efve. Nothing\u2019s perfect, so anything is okay is... (chuckles) equally ridiculous, really. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s sort of a permission, a blanket permission, then that\u2019s a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: That\u2019s, yeah, and it often feels that way to me. It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, you know, we can\u2019t make it perfect, so we might as well just not try to do anything at all.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">(pause 00:15:37 to 00:16:00)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Well, and you see that perfectionism in Tanya, although it typically manifests more in relation to herself. I mean, she feels it most acutely, and then most dramatically when she feels she\u2019s falling short of being perfect. But the issue of perfectionism is definitely like, I think you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">relate to that, just, it\u2019s not as sort of, you don\u2019t hold yourself to the kind of rigidity she does. (pause) Are you confused by my comment on it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: No, no. Meta-confused. We\u2019re doing something different today than we usually do. I\u2019m pleased by it, though, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Oh. Well, how do you mean. What are we doing differently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Um... I feel like you\u2019re talking a lot more (therapist affirms) and I also feel like you\u2019re... it\u2019s as if you\u2019re pushing in some specific direction. You\u2019re continuing to bring us back to some like, set, fixed (inaudible). I don\u2019t know if my, I don\u2019t know how the... I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s working <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">on your end, and I feel like I\u2019ve now disturbed it by talking about it, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562678\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Then that, that there is certainly intentionality, you\u2019re imputing that I\u2019m (chuckles) I\u2019m not feeling like I\u2019m going to a particular direction, consciously, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s fine. Um, yeah. I guess I... (pause) Yeah, that\u2019s fine. Anyway, yeah, thank you. You\u2019re keeping things moving in a... particular... line of summoning things that we\u2019ve talked about before, to continue the conversation we\u2019re having at present. Which, it\u2019s not that you don\u2019t do that ever, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">but you... several in a row. Anyway, so, Tanya, perfectionism; me, not the same internal rigidity, yes. And it... (pause) Yeah, and it\u2019s really problematic. I\u2019m like, I understand... the desire for perfection, but... You know, I don\u2019t think you and I talked about, but she and I, and Dr. Jannis talked <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F2\">a couple of weeks ago about anger and... the sense in which one of the... not the only, but one of the causes of her... self-injury and suicidality is her utter inability to deal with anger from anyone else or herself. That\u2019s my description of it. There is, not theirs, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">She\u2019ll get angry and... she\u2019s not allowed to express the anger, by herself. She does not allow herself to express the anger, because any expression of anger is bad, because... I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t follow the logic of it, it\u2019s a particular emotional or traumatic logic, but... It\u2019s not okay to express <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">the anger, and so... she internalizes it, something like being angry because she is angry, but becoming angry at herself for being angry at someone else, and wanting to express that. Then that ends up in self-injury and if it... goes on long enough or is particularly acute, suicidality. So... (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200612\">responds) You know, now I, I guess you were talking about ways that I can understand and relate, and I\u2019m talking about now the piece that I really can\u2019t relate to, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">(pause 00:20:12 to 00:21:28)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">Now I have the sense that by talking about what we\u2019re doing, I\u2019ve disturbed it.

(pause) Yeah, \u201clost\u201d is the word that... comes to mind, more than ruined. (therapist affirms) But yet, there is a sense of... yeah, I guess there is a sense of ruined to it, just isn\u2019t the... You know, I understand why you ask the question before, it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">sort of resonates the word does, does that make sense? (therapist affirms) So... (pause) Or sometimes the opposite happens. It\u2019s like... very much yes and then also, like, yes, I can see why you were asking that. That question makes some kind of particular sense. (therapist affirms)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">(pause 00:23:32 to 00:24:18)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">Yeah, yeah. (pause) Like by talking about it, I made it go away, so... Yeah, there is a sense of ruined, I think. (pause) Of course, there is also a... you know, by asking that question, you were also demonstrating that that wasn\u2019t really true, so... Kind of a... an interesting... (pause) You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">I feel like a question is about how I interpret... the world in a sort of... fairly fundamental way. In a conversation that we\u2019re having, that\u2019s about how I interpret the world... but I also feel like, one of the things that you... sometimes suggest is that I interpret the world... for lack of a better <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200752\">word, incorrectly like, I have not ruined this conversation in any real sense. I\u2019ve perturbed it, in the sense of... every time one of us speaks, the conversation is altered, but that\u2019s the meaning of conversation, so...

(client <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">chuckles) dealing with that like, at this moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019m not sure what... you know, that\u2019s certainly not one thing. It\u2019s maybe to some extent unknowable, but it\u2019s still interesting what creates those shifts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">(pause 00:27:03 to 00:28:35)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: I think, I think there is a difference in... I mean like, I don\u2019t have an answer, but... I feel like a large part of what we\u2019re doing here is struggling to interpret or understand what\u2019s going on in my life or me. When we get to a point where I feel like I understand something, then often... <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">my focus will shift to... back to you, in some sense. (therapist responds) It\u2019s like, that\u2019s where we start the session, is, you know... I\u2019m acutely aware that you\u2019re present. (therapist affirms) Then I come back to that when I... I feel like I have things in hand or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">But that, maybe that\u2019s a good description, because that\u2019s also somewhat true emotionally, so... The couple of times we\u2019ve sat largely in silence for periods of time. You... suggested during one of those that you thought it was very important to give people space, that\u2019s just a thing that was missing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">from our culture more generally... (pause) So, years ago, I used to be able to like, look at a person and think while I was doing it. Somewhere, I don\u2019t know... early in my... PhD program... I stopped being able to do that. I don\u2019t know exactly why. Something like being acutely aware of what\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200832\">on with you interrupts my thought process, so I... (chuckles) It is not helped by my advisor, who has like, very bright blue eyes and sits very attentively like... like a pleasant bird, but it was just like, has a very intense gaze, and will wait for you to talk. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: Like a therapist?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: In (chuckles) many ways, yeah. But... much more expectantly. (therapist responds) I feel like, especially you and... you sit and I feel that there is an expectation that I will speak, but your gaze is not particularly expectant, if that makes sense. (therapist affirms) Like, you\u2019re not staring <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">at me like, \u201cOkay, what are you going to say now? It\u2019s your turn to talk.\u201d Whereas... in some ways that\u2019s the gaze Gerard has. I don\u2019t think he... I think he both realizes it and does not realize it. It\u2019s the gaze he has after he\u2019s asked if there are questions in the class or asked a question. He will <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200872\">look around the room and wait for someone to respond. He seems perfectly content to wait for long periods of time, or some (inaudible). It has the effect of when there are actually questions, someone will eventually ask the question, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562678\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: So, do you think that\u2019s coincidental? Or that was actually a...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: Causative?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Causative, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: I have no idea. I observed it both... co-occurred. I think... you know, as an explanation, so I read recently that old people are not any dumber than they were when they were young, like, you know, at 70. They just have a lot more information to process and so it takes them longer to find particular facts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: Hmm, interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, but it was... I found it interesting. So, you know, I\u2019ve learned a whole lot in the last several years and it... it gets hard to sort out individual facts. I find when I\u2019m learning a whole lot all at once like, it takes longer to process individual things. So I think... <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200931\">those two things happening at the same time... play into it (therapist affirms) and maybe makes sense in this context where... one way of describing why I\u2019m here is that I can\u2019t process all of what\u2019s happening or happened, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: (pause) I think that\u2019s why people come to therapy in general, or sort of the frameworks they have for processing it are not working. There is too much new experience to incorporate and it\u2019s not fitting in with the, you know, the... pre-existing constructs. (pause) It\u2019s not simply intellectual, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200951\">it\u2019s emotionally, one is overwhelmed by the information. The information can be feelings and it\u2019s not just facts (client affirms), but often is feelings, or usually feelings and you know, maybe cognitive information that\u2019s just overwhelming the system. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: (pause) So I have, I have a sense of how one eventually makes sense of facts. But do you feel like one makes sense of emotions in the same way, over time? Is there a different... set of... constructs or tools or... features about oneself that allow him to process emotional or emotions, feelings?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know how to answer that off the bat. What do you think? It sounds like you had some thoughts behind, at, in terms of just even constructing the question as you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yes, I had the experience of, as you were talking about it. (pause) You know, you were talking about it and it made good sense, then you sort of said, \u201cBut also not intellectually, you know, it\u2019s not just facts, it\u2019s also feelings.\u201d Yeah, of course. But I have a much less clear sense of... (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">how do you sort out feelings? (pause) Yeah, and I guess, one of the ways that I do that is I (chuckles) project them into the \u201cfact space,\u201d so that I... recognize, we talk and... that, in a sense... identifies and tags feelings and particular trends in my feelings. Then I monitor those when they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B2\">happening. That allows me to... continue to experience them as feelings, but also recognize... that\u2019s part of a repeated thing, in some sense. This is... \u201cI feel like things are ruined.\u201d It\u2019s okay. They are not ruined. They... Not only are they not ruined, they\u2019re probably not very damaged, and at this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B3\">point. Things are still... likely to be very salvageable. (therapist affirms) That\u2019s, you know, some line like that is sufficient to get back into the space where I can, where I have sufficient agency to do things, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah, I guess... my then answer to that after hearing what you\u2019re saying is that I don\u2019t think of facts and feelings as sort of having separate trajectories, but they\u2019re linked, they\u2019re associated. So I mean, certainly facts stick out because... there are feelings attached to those <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">facts. (pause) And so by processing the facts, you can also be processing the feelings. Because that thought of \u201cthings aren\u2019t ruined\u201d has a feeling associated to it, much more pleasant than (client chuckles) the fact \u201cthings are ruined.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562678\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">CLIENT: Sure, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">(pause 00:38:04 to 00:38:28)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">Yeah, at this point, I\u2019m just sort of curious and... I\u2019ve sort of described a way that I process feelings. It\u2019s certainly not the only one, I don\u2019t think, but it\u2019s very important in that kind of time. How do other people process feelings?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Hmm. (pause) That\u2019s a, I don\u2019t know how to answer that question. It\u2019s so broad. (pause) I would say that you\u2019ve given an example of one way you process feelings. You probably process feelings a lot of different ways. That\u2019s not the only way you process it, but that was an elegant example <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A51\">of one way of processing them. (client affirms) So, when you say \u201cother people,\u201d probably the ways other people process it, you process them too. (client affirms) But it would be hard for me to articulate. Nothing sort of comes to mind at the moment. It might.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">(pause 00:39:29 to 00:41:23)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: What do you do, while I am... thinking, over there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Hmm! Do, in terms of what I do think about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">CLIENT: I, you don\u2019t have to think about anything. I was... that particular formulation of the question supposes an answer, and so, but I really meant what do you do. Do you think about other things as a, you know, anything or... because there is a real sense in which like, I am engaged in something <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD1\">else. I have no idea what you\u2019re doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">THERAPIST: So this is not a question to evade that question. (client chuckles and affirms) But I am curious about this. Do you think about that in other situations as well, when you\u2019re with other people? Or is it just that we tend not to be, we\u2019re not exactly interactive in a way, at those moments, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF1\">and that\u2019s what makes you curious, in a way that it would be less likely in other social situations for that to happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">CLIENT: (pause) Um... you know, I think it, that there is an element in which it\u2019s like, it\u2019s a particular feature of like, we are here having a conversation, and I think about something else for a while. But that\u2019s a... that\u2019s a feature of... of meetings, often. One person is usually talking, usually <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B11\">there is lots of other people who are not talking, so they\u2019re doing something. It\u2019s also a feature of like, dinner with more than one person, so I... And I do wonder like, what other people are thinking about in other contexts, also, but... Sometimes I have a clear sense of what they\u2019re doing, and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B12\">do hear. So like, in a lot of meetings, I know which of my colleagues are spending most of the time on their phone, because they really don\u2019t want to be in the meeting and were hardly engaged when they were looking at it. (therapist affirms) So I don\u2019t ask them what they were doing, because I know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B13\">if that makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s, yeah, I have two different thoughts. My first thought is, direct answer is, I see what happens. Not just like, what happens between us, I see what happens in me, where my mind goes, what I\u2019m feeling and then try, as it\u2019s happening, to reflect on what that could be about. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B31\">some, I guess, then doing two things. I\u2019m both trying to let something evolve inside me and then also, try to think about that at the same time. Sometimes I\u2019m doing more of one than the other, which is why sometimes I have a lot of things to say, because I\u2019m thinking very much about what\u2019s going on. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B32\">Sometimes I\u2019m letting things (inaudible) I don\u2019t actually have any words for it, so I don\u2019t have anything to say. I don\u2019t want to just talk for the sake of talking.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562678\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">But, so that was what one thought is, a direct answer. But the other thought I had is, we\u2019ve talked about it all along, and we\u2019ve talked about it today, but it\u2019s sometimes it\u2019s sort of similar to the foreground of just how sort of acutely aware and sensitive you are about, with the people around you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B51\">you\u2019re very homed in on them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B7\">CLIENT: (pause) Yes, to the last part. I have... not a lot to say there, but I think that\u2019s probably the place we should, the thing we should talk about. But thank you for the direct answer also. That was very interesting and it very much matches my experience of like... how you interact with me. (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B71\">affirms) You know, you\u2019ll often say something like, \u201cThis came to my mind.\u201d Which is... entirely consistent with what you just said, that it, you know... So thanks for sharing that. I appreciate now what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I do, we\u2019re going to need to stop James (ph), but I do, I do agree that this sort of, this sensitivity you have, you know, this sort of acute sensitivity, is something to talk about and think about together, that there is a lot there. But, we do need to stop for today. (client affirms) So <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B91\">I\u2019ll see you next week!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB\">CLIENT: All right, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Okay, great!
