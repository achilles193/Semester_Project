I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Do you not feel like I can help you feel calm? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Oh no, I\u2019m just kind of blank. [Laughing] And I\u2019m trying to think of what to say. [Laughing] I don\u2019t know what to bring up. (pause) I guess I had like a therapy session with my friend last night so [Laughing].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure what you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Oh no, I just talked things with him. So I felt quite relieved afterwards. [Laughing] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">So now I [Laughing]\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Talking to your friend felt like talking to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: No, it was just it\u2019s different because like we were laughing and then we were I was really like down I was a bit down yesterday and I just wanted to get home from class and work and be productive and stuff. But I didn\u2019t do any work and there was (inaudible at 00:07:39) after school, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">I learned that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">And then my gay friend [Laughing], he needed some help so, I was helping him. And he was like and so I was like okay, now that I\u2019m helping him, he still would want to (inaudible at 00:07:55).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">He was like oh no, I\u2019ll help you, what\u2019s up. And I\u2019m like I don\u2019t want to talk to you, you\u2019re not really a good listener. He was like no, I am; talk to me.  [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">So I was talking to him just about other things (inaudible at 00:08:10) about how confused (inaudible at 00:08:13). [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">He was saying ridiculous things so it made me laugh and then I (inaudible at 00:08:23). [Laughing] It\u2019s like, you know, I guess I compare myself to other people; other people as in my age or just slightly older, like two years older, their lives seem so sad, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">I have a baby and make another friend have a baby and it was like, you know, where\u2019s my life going? It\u2019s not it\u2019s all over the place. I wind up in this little apartment and I don\u2019t like it; how dirty it is. I want to clean it and take ownership of it and make it nice, but I don\u2019t want to invest in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">that my time in doing that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">And I miss the apartment I shared with Chris (sp) and, you know, that seemed like such a life, you know, saving on rent. And you know it\u2019s not just like that, it was the time we shared together cooking and eating together, I was missing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">You know but it\u2019s also true that like people who I compare myself to. I mean, I just (inaudible at 00:09:46) a rosy picture of their lives too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">Like there was this friend who just had a baby. I don\u2019t think she and her husband were that settled. They\u2019re quite, you know, radical as well, and she teaches filmmaking and she travels a lot, so I don\u2019t know how settled she is. I think they have a nice place. I visited them last week.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">And this other woman who I keep thinking about, and I don\u2019t really like her. [Laughing] But I was hanging out with her and another friend, and she has a baby and her husband is in Nepal for a few for a week or so and she was very lonely and she was saying that she was like yes, I lost my baby twice <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">in the mall today.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562640\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">We were at the mall and I was just kind of picturing her by herself kind of, you know, pushing her stroller, you know, during the day in the mall and, you know, how lonely she must have felt and what she does and what people do to kind of make themselves feel better. You know, how they deal with just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">the same emotions that I deal with, we all deal with the same stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">So (pause)\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: People having babies is on your mind and no one having one too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: [Laughing], yes you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Do you wonder about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: A bit. I mean I\u2019m always very like I used to be very good with kids and like yes, I\u2019m very motherly. [Laughing] But I just don\u2019t have the choice to have one. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever have one. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Why do you say that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Oh, I don\u2019t know. [Laughing] Because I can\u2019t even seem to like to get married so [Laughing].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: But I wonder if you wonder what my life is or what I think about a baby or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: [Laughing], no. No, I was like comparing myself to friends who have babies. I know it\u2019s very hard work. So I\u2019m not like oh baby, nice to hold or whatever. I know it\u2019s not like that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">I mean it would totally feel like a burden I know. [Laughing] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">(pause) I need to stop feeling burdened by stuff, you know. I still have not fixed that. I think we talked about that like a year and a half ago; maybe even two years ago, where I\u2019m still not, you know, able to let go of that mindset thinking in terms of that it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to don\u2019t feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">like doing seems like such a burden to me. Like I feel trapped or I feel something. [Laughing] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">So I am kind of over school now. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not it\u2019s not that much of I find the effort not to seem like a burden in the middle of the trap, but because, you know, it\u2019s new, it\u2019s refreshing in the sense that every week you learn something new. But that\u2019s not true anymore. [Laughing] I stopped <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">learning new things a while back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">So see I\u2019m same, same, same but it\u2019s kind of recreational at this point; mildly recreational. And I have the assistantship so I\u2019m continuing. And I keep talking to everyone and like I\u2019m going to quit; I\u2019m going to quit and people go no, you just have two more classes to go. See if you can transfer credits <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">So (pause) yes, one more year is not that much work. So I\u2019ll put myself on auto-pilot again. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">I don\u2019t know what kind of measure to use; what kind of question like framework to have in terms of what I should do like do stuff that makes me feel empowered or you know, I don\u2019t or learn stuff learning stuff doesn\u2019t necessarily make me feel empowered. It makes me like feel humble and, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">I don\u2019t know enough. So it\u2019s like it\u2019s building it\u2019s not as much empowering me I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m confused. [Laughing] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">I\u2019m thinking more and more about having a job, you know, whether it should be full-time or part-time and (pause). And I\u2019m confused about Chris (inaudible at 00:16:58). So it\u2019s like a lot of unsteadiness I feel like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">So I guess I\u2019m trying to anchor myself and the boat isn\u2019t anchored and I just want it to be as strong as I can make it. I don\u2019t know how to do that. The only way I can think of is spending as much time working on it as I can, thinking about it and just making it as big and strong of an anchor, you know.

Do you feel very focused?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: What does that look like? [Laughing] Like (inaudible at 00:18:49)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know.

I might be somewhat determined and obsessed, but that\u2019s not the same as focused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What did you have in mind when you said distractions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: No, I just wondered like I was imagining talking, saying all this to my mom. I don\u2019t know what she would say. A slightly different version of my mom where you would say, no need to distract yourself. All these are distractions; boys. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: So you were wondering if would respond the way your mother would?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yes. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Why would I respond in a similar way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: No, I was just imagining talking to like an elder and like you know, seeking wisdom. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: So a wiser person would say that you are seeking distractions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: [Laughing] I was just wondering, am I. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: You seem kind of disengaged today. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: [Laughing] Yes, I don\u2019t really know what realms to bring up or, you know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">If I don\u2019t have something to focus on I don\u2019t really think I\u2019m really focused [Laughing] or engage in, again, there\u2019s nothing to engage in probably. [Laughing] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Your goals; your aspirations?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Those are things to engage with. I\u2019m trying to do X, so I\u2019m going to engage with how I get there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like I want to X, so how do I get there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yes.

Should I get a job; should I not get a job? Should I deal with (inaudible at 00:24:47)? You\u2019re not really sure how to even think about what you want and then, you know, getting it\u2019s a little bit too specific, but having a plan to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">get there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">But if you\u2019re not feeling very anchored or focused, because you\u2019re not feeling compelled or driven to something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yes, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Because you\u2019ve certainly come in here at times and been like I want to talk about this. I\u2019ve been thinking about it and I really want to talk about it. And you haven\u2019t been like that lately. You\u2019ve seemed kind of distracted and kind of keeping to yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yes (pause). Well I guess I was worried about stuff money and something. I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">How do you get out of this? I mean I\u2019m writing but it\u2019s not like chugging along with great speed or anything. (pause) I don\u2019t know if I work this weekend or not. [Laughing] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">I\u2019m taking my laptop and writing at a friend\u2019s place. (pause) I\u2019m trying to feel anchored.

I was able to focus earlier much more, I guess even just a few weeks ago right, when did I seem more engaged a few weeks ago? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been, but definitely there\u2019s some period of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yes. So like over the break; the winter break I had a plan. (pause) I wanted to like go through the entire draft and put a draft together. And I kind of lost a few days here and there because of helping my friend and stuff. But I still kind of I had a plan and I stuck to it and I think I wrote <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">pretty much every day for like several hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">So like end of February that deadline ended. So then since then I\u2019m kind of like a little less anchored I guess. It\u2019s been a month. [Laughing] So, but not that I haven\u2019t been writing since then; I have been. It\u2019s just not been as kind of, well I have to do it; I have to do it, like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">So I\u2019m not that driven because there isn\u2019t a tight plan, like a right deadline. (pause) I wonder if I function better if I\u2019m really busy, you know, and busy with stuff I want to do? I guess right now I\u2019m like I have a lot of things that I\u2019m confused about like travel (inaudible at 00:29:43). [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">Like this fitness thing, should I become an instructor or not? Can I do it or not? [Laughing] (pause) Is there a way to get engaged, like other than recognizing an anger and making a plan? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Sounds like a good way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: It sounds like a good way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yes. Are there like shortcuts like I don\u2019t know, sex or something? [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not following.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Well I don\u2019t know. Like you feel it\u2019s a way of feeling invigorated or something, like you get out of a funk, probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I see. Are you feeling like you\u2019re in a funk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: No, not a funk, but more like disengaged and like what do I grasp. What do I hold on to and not get swayed by other things.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">I mean I guess that\u2019s why I don\u2019t feel very motivated. I\u2019m taking a very easy class and that\u2019s like really [Laughing] I can\u2019t like going to school drunk just so I can get through like those three hours. [Laughing] Not that I\u2019 going to do it, but it\u2019s like not painful. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: So what\u2019s painful about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Well it\u2019s just like the teacher is kind of old and she just kind of goes on [Laughing] and just like it\u2019s a poetry class so like she can spend like an hour talking about one poem. And it\u2019s just like you know, it\u2019s just so plain, you know. It\u2019s just not challenging enough for me at all. [Laughing] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">It\u2019s like I really have to just like somehow get through it. I don\u2019t know. [Laughing] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">I guess that\u2019s why I that\u2019s another reason to look for a job. More of these classes and then just in order to finish the degree I don\u2019t know, like I don\u2019t know how I can just like feel like I\u2019m wasting my time and my money. I could be making money instead of, you know, sitting in this class, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">I could be reading a book I like.

[Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Why is it hard?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: You want me to tell you it\u2019s hard for you to make decisions because\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yes. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: So I think this is one of the things that really stands in your way that sometimes when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or distracted you become very passive and you sort of like oh, tell me why I do this. Tell me why I do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">It\u2019s hard for you to sort of move more to the center of your life. You kind of are sort of looking for somebody else to take over, but it\u2019s hard to find someone [Coughing] who will take over your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yes. How do I change that behavior? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Well certainly by observing it first. But I\u2019ve seen you do this before, now that I think about it. It\u2019s sort of like you sort of wait on the periphery of your life and hope something changes, like rather than taking charge and making decisions which is too bad because you know, you have a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">lot of good options and opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">In part because not in large part because you created them and because you\u2019re talented, and you do make things happen but then you step back. Like you apply to this program that you get into which is wonderful. There\u2019s drawbacks, like it\u2019s expensive, and you need to find out a way to make this happen <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E11\">if you want it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">And then you kind of pull back and like oh I don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t know. And then you kind of dilly dally or something. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: [Laughing] Yes, I know. I\u2019m looking for jobs. I mean that\u2019s active, right. That\u2019s taking control. And how something means panicking I\u2019m going I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. Someone tell me what to do. I guess that\u2019s my nature. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s talk about that because I do I think that you\u2019re on to something. I think that that\u2019s what part of what\u2019s holding you back that you start to panic. What are you panicking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Why I make the wrong decisions. [Laughing] (pause) There are so many options I feel like I need someone to guide me. But then I guess I can, when I think about it, after you pointed it out, I can, you know, step back and make a plan and think things through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">Like yes, there\u2019s so many options. There\u2019s so many jobs on Craig\u2019s List every day. How do I sort through them? How do I evaluate each one and make an informed decision, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">[Laughing] I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like random thoughts come to my head and like this makes sense. Like it can be in one line like my house, and then the Square, you know, two miles down the same road. And then down the same road you keep walking across the river like walk for like two more miles or two <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED1\">and a half more miles there\u2019s a place where this novel class workshop is going to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">And I\u2019m applying for a job in the Square. So that\u2019s what I mean like random thoughts, you know, like that\u2019s fairly near and it makes sense, therefore I should take this job. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">Yes, so yes just I guess I just can\u2019t make the first. I\u2019m afraid of being bored; afraid of, you know, a negative outcome.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">I mean what will happen? Like what\u2019s the worst that can happen? Why am I so afraid?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a very good question. What is the worst that can happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: I come home tired and stressed out every day most of the time. And I don\u2019t want to work with my mom. And I feel stuck and trapped. I guess that\u2019s the worst. I cannot quit.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562640\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Are you thinking about getting a summer job so you\u2019d have enough money to start the program in the fall? Is that how I don\u2019t, you know, what is your thinking? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. So I applied to a bunch of jobs and only this one got back, so like a full-time job; permanent job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: And when does the program start?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: In May.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: And is that like something that you go to classes for or what like what are your obligations?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: Yes, it\u2019s like a Monday night thing I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: I see. So it\u2019s not a daytime thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: And then school starts in September, but I don\u2019t get paid from like I don\u2019t get paid in June, July, and August. (pause) And the next step is to ask my teachers if they know of some jobs. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">Mostly I\u2019m feeling guilty for not helping my mom with her rent this month.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: I know paying your rent is a big deal and you have mentioned that you didn\u2019t do it this month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yes so, but she\u2019s like she\u2019s paying from her savings and stuff and I feel bad about that. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with her situation. I was like we all thought that this like internship was going to be paid but it\u2019s not. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">Also she\u2019s working every day at a school but it\u2019s like the student teaching and it\u2019s not paid for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: Did they tell her she was going to get paid and then didn\u2019t pay her or what happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">CLIENT: No, we didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why we assumed she was going to get paid, but it seemed like a job, you know, so that\u2019s why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think student teaching usually get paid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">CLIENT: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">THERAPIST: But she didn\u2019t know to ask?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yes. But it\u2019s a long assignment, right. It\u2019s like a whole semester. It\u2019s not like, you know, two days or two days a week even, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">THERAPIST: I know when I was in grad school my internship for years was unpaid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">THERAPIST: I worked like 25 hours a week or something and was not paid. So it does when you\u2019re in training the pay is considered the education you get from the training. It\u2019s not true in all fields, but it\u2019s not unusual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">CLIENT: Okay, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">THERAPIST: And student teaching, I don\u2019t think student teachers typically get paid. But I guess it sounds like she wasn\u2019t you know she didn\u2019t know to ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">CLIENT: Yes, I mean that\u2019s okay. Maybe in May she\u2019ll get a job. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">THERAPIST: How did you decide not to pay it this month; her rent?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">CLIENT: I just same way I decided to go to the (inaudible at 00:40:59). It wasn\u2019t really a decision. It was like that [Laughing] ignored it. Oops, slipped my mind kind of, that\u2019s what I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">THERAPIST: I think you feel so much better about your life the more you can take ownership of your decisions. It sounds like you decided not to pay it, but you didn\u2019t want to take ownership for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">And there\u2019s reasons why, because you allowed to feel guilty. It\u2019s understandable, but I think you\u2019re feeling like you\u2019re kind of not in control of your life. Like you started by saying today, everything feels like I want to feel calm. Everything feels out of control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s in your power to have that control, but I think it scares you to take that control. Say this is what I\u2019m deciding to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20132-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20132-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562640\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">CLIENT: Yes. That\u2019s why I cannot decide so many things, you know. Like follow around like I don\u2019t want to decide because I\u2019ll be a no this is something I know I\u2019ll get bored with them, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">And now I know that I might also get bored with (inaudible at 00:42:34) [Laughing] or, you know, not bored I guess, feel guilty for giving up on it. So I guess that\u2019s a different problem but it\u2019s like similar in the sense that I cannot take ownership for my decision so, I\u2019m not deciding. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">THERAPIST: Well if it\u2019s true that you will feel bored with either of them and you don\u2019t want to be with a man that you feel bored with, you can go find somebody else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">CLIENT: [Laughing] Keep looking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">THERAPIST: People do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\">THERAPIST: If that\u2019s how you feel, that\u2019s what you feel is going on. I almost wonder like there are so many sort of decisions or maybe even not decisions but events, in your at least in your mother\u2019s life and maybe in your father\u2019s life that were like catastrophic, that maybe it\u2019s hard for you to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201411\">imagine that, you know, maybe make a decision and maybe think, well this maybe not have been the best decision, but so what.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">You know, so then you just have other decisions. Like nothing is catastrophic. It\u2019s just okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20145\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">THERAPIST: Maybe that\u2019s what scares you so much. Because it begs the question of what\u2019s a wrong decision. I mean sometimes you make a decision and it doesn\u2019t turn out the way you want. Is that wrong; I don\u2019t wrong to me implies that you\u2019re making it for the wrong reasons. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">You can\u2019t always know the outcome of a decision. It may not go your way, but then is that the end of the world?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">CLIENT: Well like for my mom is was, right. She married the wrong man and that was catastrophic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s what I mean, that that has been your model, that decisions have been catastrophic for your mother certainly.
