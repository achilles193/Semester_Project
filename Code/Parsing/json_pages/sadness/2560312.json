(laughs) Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: How was it to do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Um. It was pretty easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: (laughs) I'm very familiar with these descriptions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yep, yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: What I don't know is, are these So before looking at this, are they on your mind as concepts pretty readily?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yes. But I would say I look at Ivan and say, \"That's a little black and white.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Or, \"That's a little \" Like I can -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Uh huh. Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: But it's hard for me I guess to do it as much with myself. And even if I do, even if I am aware that that's a bit, it's still hard to pull back because some of the emotions that go with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. So, well versed intellectually, and then there's concepts. And it sounds like you've been recognizing it in someone else pretty quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: In yourself is another thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right. And it's hard to be objective when you're looking at yourself -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: and thinking, \"Is this all or nothing thinking?\" Or, \"Is this a little more realistic than I want to admit?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: So it's hard sometimes. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Were there any that did feel ambiguous or anything you wanted to about specifically as you were filling it out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Um. I think emotional reasoning is one that I felt a little stumped on. I guess I feel like I do it but I'm not quite sure what a good example would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I mean, I gave one but I don't know if it's as good as it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: What was the example that you gave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: That sometimes I'm worried that things in my marriage might not improve enough. Or, what if they don't? Or all of the \"what ifs.\" And then, \"What am I going to do if it doesn't? What am I going to \"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: And I wonder if that isn't based on how it feels more than based on the progress that's been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Like the timeline or facts or the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yes. Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: So that feels a little less concrete of an example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: No, but I follow you as an example. In that example, can you identify what is the feeling then? So if you're reasoning with emotions, what's the emotion?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: I think it's fear, mostly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: Anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: The \"what if.\" Yea, anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So does this I actually think this is one of the hardest ones for people to really get inside themselves and work with, more than any of the others. They get intellectually a grasp of one but then you need to [reply to them] (ph) from intellect down to the emotion. This one, basically, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D1\">the idea is that if you have a feeling it does not mean that it's indicating a fact about a situation. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">THERAPIST: You get that. So, you're extremely afraid that nothing will ever change. Is that? What's the thought? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">CLIENT: There's that but there's also the, uh, things might be changing somewhat but it's not fast enough, it's not this enough, it's not enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">CLIENT: And it doesn't meet up where my expectations It doesn't meet up where I thought things would be, so what if it doesn't continue to progress. Or what if it doesn't progress at a rapid enough rate? What if it And it snowballs a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560312\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: But then if I would go through the steps to try to rationalize it, I would think, \"Actually, that's a lot of progress in a short period of time.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Or, \"Actually, this, this and this. There are really good steps that have made a big difference.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: But then I sometimes have a little bit of a forgiving thought, where I think to myself, \"I've put up with, you know, a lot of this type of thing for a really long time.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: \"No wonder I'm, you know, kind of really impatient and ready to move on, be done with it.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: And so I sometimes think that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. This example, I think, is a little complicated for good reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: That's what you're bringing up. So, for example, I hear you also in what you're describing, \"What if this never changes?\" is there's still a lot of anger. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Because it's not just, \"Oh, things were exactly what I thought they were, and then he's changed a lot, and I'm just not giving him credit for that.\" He is changing and yet that's coupled with your also knowing, and still coming into knowing, that he was never where you thought he was to begin with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: So it does sound like you have some realistic anxiety, actually. Not just irrational about, \"What if he changes a lot and that's still where he gets to, still feels like it's not enough for me.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: Mm hm. And I also worry that I guess I could change my expectations and lower them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: Because I feel like this is terribly critical but I think to myself like, not pushing him to apply to other jobs. I'm even growing to be content with him being a manager at Subway because he's struggling with it still at times. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">CLIENT: And I wonder if, you know, more would be the answer for him. Actually, that could be worse even if it looks like a great job or more money or more whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">THERAPIST: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">CLIENT: So I find myself thinking that and I kind of don't like myself for that (laughs) because I'm thinking, \"But wait a minute. This is not at all what we thought would be the case.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">CLIENT: So I worry about that too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Again, that sounds more like it's a worry based in some understanding of the possibilities of reality. What if, for example, for him to feel like he was functioning at his best in a life that he was happy with, he was going to be a manager at Subway for the next twenty years? (laughs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D1\">You have to take in your breath even.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And he was happy doing that and he managed to find a way of functioning well doing that. What do you do then? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Is that enough for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">CLIENT: The thing that happens with that type of hypothetical scenarios is, a small part of me looks at Ivan and says, \"Why would that be?\" Like, \"What happened?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">CLIENT: Or, \"Why is that?\" You know. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AF\">CLIENT: Again, there's nothing wrong with being a manager at Subway, but if you have the potential to do something and you studied a specific field and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yep, yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B3\">CLIENT: What happens with that? What happened? So there's a small part of me that thinks that but there's a bigger part of me that thinks, \"What is wrong with me?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560312\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: That I would be the type of snobby whatever person that being married to someone who is a manager at Subway wouldn't be enough, or wouldn't be fulfilling his potential or wouldn't be -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: Like what does that say about me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Hm. So just to press you for a second, does your mind go to something in particular? What are you saying, \"What does that say about me?\" It seems like you get very self-critical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: Well, yes, and I guess I want to be self-critical of myself (laughs) in that because that's just not I would never look down at anyone who works there, but then if it's my husband who is working as a manager at Subway and I think about him doing that for twenty years -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">CLIENT: I think, \"That's not \" I don't know. It's not exactly what I would have thought would be fulfilling his potential. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">CLIENT: Or what I thought, you know, using his college education would look like. Or I guess not the type of lifestyle I thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">CLIENT: And maybe even money-wise not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">CLIENT: And he's not really passionate about working at a sandwich shop, so I would feel like it would just be a job.

I wonder though if there's a way You sort of discount it as, it shouldn't matter at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E3\">CLIENT: Maybe it can matter some. But I feel like I guess I feel like that says something pretty bad about me if that's not okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Hm. That you're snobby, is what that's about? (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, it really sounds like I'm stuck up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\">CLIENT: Like being a manager at Subway, you know, it's an honest job, it's a good job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EF\">CLIENT: But why would that not be good enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. So why would it not be good enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F3\">CLIENT: I think there is a part of that, if it was Ivan's one dream to manage a sandwich shop and he wanted to stay with this and work his way up or just keep doing it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F7\">CLIENT: that that could feel a lot better, a lot different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FB\">CLIENT: And if we came to the realistic understand that that was his passion and that's what he was going to do, but he wasn't going to pay the bills.

(laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20119\">THERAPIST: Like, in other words, like your father.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011D\">THERAPIST: I would certainly (ph) imagine that you would have a problem with that too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011F\">CLIENT: That's the weird thing because I hated never seeing my Dad. I got to the point where I didn't want to see my Dad because I was so angry at him that I was never going to come first. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20121\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20123\">CLIENT: And, yet, it was easier, in a way, because I could be proud of his, you know, great education, of his incredible work ethic.

He just saved some animal's life. He just did some crazy four hour surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20129\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012B\">CLIENT: That feels It doesn't feel good.

In a way then, with your father, that's what you were used to sort of getting to feel good about with his, at least -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20137\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20139\">THERAPIST: he's really driven, successful, smart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013F\">CLIENT: And he, compared to most of my friend's parents, nobody's (laughs) parent worked longer hours, nobody had more education that my Dad. Nobody. I felt proud of that. I do think that's okay. I think that's a healthy thing to feel proud about. I guess the other part that made it feel okay was the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2013F1\">thought in my mind that he could have if he had had, you know, partners or whatever, if he had joined a practice he could have had normal hours and made a good living -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20141\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20143\">CLIENT: and still have been this success. So it wasn't like But there was more potential for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20145\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Also, maybe in a way he's not there for you but he is very professionally successful. Maybe with Ivan right now it's feeling like you're not getting either one of those. You haven't been getting either one of those. It's not that he's the opposite of your Dad and always there for you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201451\">always catering to you. Buying you flowers, figuring out what you need, you know, putting you front and center. And he's not that successful here. So it feels like both realms -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah. It does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20149\">THERAPIST: you're missing out. And I think that's what has been really disappointing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014B\">CLIENT: It does. And I guess the other, maybe it's most important to me now at this point in my life, but my Dad is like he's not always there. And conversations with him are usually very short and he's driving on his way to a call.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2014A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560312\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014F\">CLIENT: But he's incredibly supportive. He was incredibly supportive when I was going to school.

But he would just always want to ask about it, be encouraging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20155\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20157\">CLIENT: And of looking for jobs, he's very supportive. I guess he's always wanting to talk about and be involved with jobs and academics. And that's important at this point in my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20159\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015B\">CLIENT: And Ivan is not up to talking about those topics right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015F\">CLIENT: And I guess it's also more of a It's a bigger thing because those are topics that I associate with adulthood or being, you know, mature and responsible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20161\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20163\">CLIENT: Having it together, having a career and a plan for your life, being motivated and ambitious. But I do also wonder if Ivan continues to make progress with his depression, with his attention disorder, if he continues to, like if he sort of gets to baseline with his job where he gets to the point <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201631\">where he's doing it well and things are going smoothly consistently. And he feels like he could potentially maybe he could reach that too, maybe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah. All of what we're talking about that started with this particular distortion, it does sound, Ramona I've said this before, but just to say again because you often collapse what you're thinking about his job into only, \"I must be very snobby if that's not good enough for me.\" It really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201651\">sounds like you're saying you are not drawn to him not being passionately, proactively engaged in something. Which is very different than saying, \"I just can't be married to someone who is a Subway manager.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20167\">Which you still might have a problem with. Some people might, some people might not for various reasons. Right? There are different things that feel valuable to people. But if he had come to you two years ago and said, \"You know what? I love retail, I love,\" you know, like, \"multitasking. And I'm thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201671\">I want to work to become an owner of a store one day. Or, you know, buy a franchise.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20169\">CLIENT: (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Or, \"This is what I I'm going to get into. What do you think of Subway?\" And if it had felt thoughtful and proactive and driven by a passion for something. Passion for sandwich even. You know? Like, you know, he's starting to learn about all different kinds. I mean that still might be disappointing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2016B1\">in one way if it was sort of, \"Oh, I thought I was marrying someone who was going to this.\" And, \"What does that mean for his identity?\" And, you know, \"Can I get used to that?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016D\">But maybe not in all the ways it's been disappointing because of something in his personality or attention deficit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20171\">THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20173\">CLIENT: No. Yes, it sounds accurate, actually, to what I'm feeling. And one of the biggest things that I, it doesn't feel fair to criticize, but in finding that our expectations, my expectations which he said were totally on board. Like he was on board with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20175\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20177\">CLIENT: They were correct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20179\">THERAPIST: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2017B\">CLIENT: He led me to believe this was all how it was going to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Yep.

Well, to some extent. I mean he clearly He said he left grad school because it wasn't for him. And I had a really tough time with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20181\">THERAPIST: (cross talking at 17:37)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20183\">CLIENT: But that was something I was going to be able to accept. What actually happened, not so much. But the bare problem with it is, I feel like Ivan has no clue what he wants out of life right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20185\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20187\">CLIENT: I feel like if I told him tomorrow, \"We should buy a house.\" He would be like, \"Yeah, let's work up towards that.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20189\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018B\">CLIENT: If I said, \"We should start a family tomorrow.\" He would probably That might be a little extreme, but the point is I feel like he's been wishy washy. One random job to the next.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018F\">CLIENT: And just, you know, going with whatever is given to him.

Does he ever want to, you know, own a house and things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019F\">CLIENT: I guess I feel like he has no clue and that's not something that is so acceptable to me.

(laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B5\">THERAPIST: And not a lot of space in there, in either case, for someone actually taking care of you really.

Like the most responsibilities, the most skills to be developed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CB\">CLIENT: By far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CD\">THERAPIST: It's actually a hard job. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CF\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. He's never had to manage people. He's never had to be accountable for meeting timelines throughout the day and managing his time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It's a lot of responsibilities and tasks. Yeah, and yet I also hear what you're saying, it still feels like it's a kind of holding ground in a way, rather than a sense of being chosen from a sense of self in him. And that may be what's scary right now is how little sense he has about the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N201D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560312\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D3\">CLIENT: Mm hm.

And, I don't know, I always feel bad. So even if she comes over after a long day of work and we make dinner, or even if I make her dinner, I still feel a little bad because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202D7\">THERAPIST: Hm. (pause) It's interesting. It's a dynamic that's gotten set up with her, it sounds like since you were very little. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202D9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Very much so. I mean, not only has she taken care of me, but when things with Mom and Dad were explosive -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202DB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202DD\">CLIENT: she was there to talk it out and make sure I was okay. But even to the extent of, \"Ramona, did you do this? Do you want to take care of this? How is that going?\" Just really mothering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202DF\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202E1\">CLIENT: Really mothering in a very loving way. In a very caring way. Not in a controlling way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202E3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202E5\">CLIENT: But I feel really bad about that. That must be exhausting for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202E7\">THERAPIST: Well she's doing it in a way that should have happened with your own mother, so that your sister and you could be freed up to have a sister relationship instead of more of a mothering one. So that's what's so complicated. Then you actually get this loving care which you need, and yet it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202E71\">in this place that leaves you with kind of rocky feelings about it because it's actually not where it should be coming from, even more so. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N202E6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202E6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560312\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202E9\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I feel bad because she's not telling me about her bad days. Emma is not a complainer but she's not, like nothing. And that doesn't feel like a two way street because it's not so much all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202EB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202ED\">CLIENT: She's really mostly And she'll say sometimes, \"You don't realize, Ramona, but when I come over and we do dinner or whatever, that helps even if I don't talk about how bad my day. It helps me de-stress and it helps me get a way for a little bit.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202EF\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202F1\">CLIENT: So, I don't know.

That's a poor way to put it. But I still -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202F7\">THERAPIST: You didn't get enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202F9\">CLIENT: want it or need it. And now I'm actually at an age where it's like, \"Get over it,\" (laughs) because it's no longer appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202FB\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202FD\">CLIENT: It's no longer, I should no longer need it for the most part. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202FF\">THERAPIST: So here's where I So coming back to your specific scenario. One of the things that I think gets distorted, where this self-hatred comes up, is what you're saying right now, that you should no longer need that. I don't think that's true. I think you were incredibly deprived as a child of <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202FF1\">what you needed. But I think adults need that too and that's actually what you hope to find in friends, in partners, still in one's mother and father. Right? Even as an adult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20301\">You've asked a number of times, \"What does that actually look like.\" Lacking of all models, for example, about what does it look like when a healthy married couple is doing it well?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20303\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20305\">THERAPIST: And I think it includes being quote \"somewhat motherly\" if we're going to use that as the stereotype of what does it mean to say to someone, \"How was your day? How's that going?\" You know, \"How was the interview. Oh, have you done this. Oh, how are you feeling? You were sick yesterday.\" The <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N203051\">kind of following up on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20307\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20309\">THERAPIST: If we're just calling that basically seeing and caring about the life of another person. It's fundamental to every healthy relationship. Not something you need to get over. That's what you want to be a part of your marriage. And you want it to be reciprocal. That's what's different about <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N203091\">it not being motherly. Right? In that place it's the mother's job to be that caring and concerned for the child, and for the child not necessarily, early on, to have to even think about how the mother is doing so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2030A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2030B\">CLIENT: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2030D\">THERAPIST: Over time you slowly get to know, \"Oh, Mom's having a bad day. Maybe I'll set the table for her,\" or something like that. But I think you had to be so preoccupied about your mother's mind way, way too young in your life. You were deprived of it and yet it's a normal healthy part of relationships. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2030D1\">Like, for example, this is what I say when you're going to the mall to go shopping. On any given, any given relationship any given day, you're not being selfish by having your sister wait a little bit while you try on clothes. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2030C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2030C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560312\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2030E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2030F\">It could be if she said to you, \"Ramona, I have thirty minutes and then I have to be out of here because I have a job interview. So let's do thirty minutes and then \" You know, say you were driving her. And then you kept trying on clothes and totally ignoring her deadline. I'm guessing that's not <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2030F1\">what happened. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20310\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20311\">CLIENT: No, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20312\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20313\">THERAPIST: She didn't say she had limited time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20314\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20315\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20316\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20317\">THERAPIST: So what she does for you there sounds like part of a healthy even sisterhood that that could exist in a way that's not a problem at all. It's healthier if you're doing that for her sometimes too, if it's reciprocated. And it sounds like she has a hard time taking that in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20319\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Mm hm. She does not, no. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2031A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2031B\">THERAPIST: So that might be the growing edge of your relationship with her is to be able to start saying, \"You know what? When are you going to go try on clothes because I want to be there for you. I have some time right now.\" Pushing into to taking care of her some. But I don't think the answer is <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2031B1\">going to be, oh, you just need to be not taken care of anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2031C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2031D\">I think you start to hate yourself when you get taken care of. And that's a healthy thing to want to have in every relationship. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2031E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2031F\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20320\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20321\">THERAPIST: So even there may be ways this plays out with Ivan sometimes. Can you be taken care of by him? Is there anything he could do that would actually take care of you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20322\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20323\">CLIENT: So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20324\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20325\">THERAPIST: And can you Oh, go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20326\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20327\">CLIENT: No, I didn't mean to interrupt. That's something Dr. Farrow (ph) just came up with. She said that we should work with our individual therapists and come up with something that the other could do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20328\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20329\">THERAPIST: Oh. Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2032A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2032B\">CLIENT: Every day. She said, \"I think it should be every day.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2032D\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2032E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2032F\">CLIENT: She gave the example of, she said, \"Every couple does this. There's something they need from the other one \"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20330\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20331\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20332\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20333\">CLIENT: \" and it's not the, 'you do the dishes, I do the laundry.'\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20334\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20335\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20336\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20337\">CLIENT: She said it's like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20338\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20339\">THERAPIST: Something more emotional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2033A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2033B\">CLIENT: Yeah. So she says it could be, \"I need you to meet me every day at five o'clock after work at home.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2033C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2033D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2033E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2033F\">CLIENT: \" and have a glass a wine and talk about my day, and ask about it.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20340\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20341\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Mm hm. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20342\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20343\">CLIENT: She said that could be one partner's request and that that's So she said we should work with (laughs) and try to come up with something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20344\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20345\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20346\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20347\">CLIENT: Do I have? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20348\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20349\">THERAPIST: That's so We have five minutes.

It's so interesting because in some ways it's sort of making explicit, \"Here's what I need to be taken care of. Can you do this thing?\" And not only can you do it, but can I take it in then? What is it like when this need <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2034D1\">gets met? Have you thought of anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2034E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2034F\">CLIENT: I thought about (laughs) I told her I thought it was hard because sometimes the baseline, like that you do the laundry, I do the dishes, doesn't get met.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20350\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20351\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20352\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20353\">CLIENT: And I'm like, \"Why would I add something else to the list when we're not, you know.

All the way from the beginning was that you were going expect something was going to work out within the first month or two even. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N203A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560312\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203A2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203A3\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203A4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203A5\">THERAPIST: Pretty much every single person who applies for a job in whatever field right now, the average time to get a job is six to eight months at least. Right? That is the state of affairs in employment. It's incredibly competitive. There are people applying for jobs who are extremely over qualified. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203A51\">There are people who are applying for jobs that then get filled internally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203A6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203A8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203A9\">THERAPIST: They only had to advertise it. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203AA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203AB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203AC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203AD\">THERAPIST: So it sounds like you really need to work hard to adjust your expectations about the time frame. And think more about applying for your job as your job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203AE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203AF\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203B0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203B1\">THERAPIST: Meaning -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203B2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203B3\">CLIENT: Oh, that you -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203B4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203B5\">THERAPIST: that you set specific times. If it becomes this thing, \"I have to get, I have to get, I have to get, I have to get,\" then you are going to build helplessness every day that passes. But the more you start to say, \"Okay,\" for example, looking at the job board every day, seven days a week, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203B51\">sounds like that's the fastest way to get yourself feeling hopeless. Because you are going to reach a point where new things aren't going to come up. It's going to feel like beating your head against a wall. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203B6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203B7\">So, I mean, I wonder if you could slot two or three days where you look and letting it go on the other days. Getting specific timeframes where you work on things. And just be thinking of this as this is part of what you're doing in the backdrop. I don't know if it feels like you have to get another <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203B71\">job in the meantime. If you knew, for example, right now it's going to take eight months until you find a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203B8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Clearly I need to be working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203BA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203BB\">THERAPIST: You would.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203BC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203BD\">CLIENT: Of course. Where's the money going to come from? One positive thing I did, which I'm hoping will help, is I joined, career services set up this job seekers workshop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203BE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203BF\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C1\">CLIENT: And it's literally for new graduates -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C3\">THERAPIST: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C5\">CLIENT: plus the Dean of Career Services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C7\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C9\">CLIENT: Meeting once a week and doing a check in and talk about strategies and things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203CA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203CB\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203CC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203CD\">CLIENT: But I feel like I need to push myself to go to networking events and to do more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203CE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203D0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203D1\">CLIENT: Like getting more resumes out there even though I feel self-conscious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203D2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203D3\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203D4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203D5\">CLIENT: Because not only just in an application but just professors I know that may or may not have research for me. Like no opportunities, just reaching out to them and letting them know I'm looking. Things like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203D6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203D7\">THERAPIST: Yep. I think one of the hardest things for you about this process and the reality of finding and solidifying a job, which is not just for you but for anyone. And probably specifically for any new graduate in a field where you're coming out with less experience than somebody else, is the hit <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203D71\">rate is very, very, very low. Meaning you could go through three hundred applications and one of them will come through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203D8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203D9\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203DA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203DB\">THERAPIST: And the problem is, let's say you get up to two hundred and eleven, and then two hundred and twelve, and two hundred and thirteen. And now what you're saying to yourself, \"I put in two hundred and thirteen applications and not a single one of them has come to fruition.\" So it can feel more <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203DB1\">hopeless. But if you know in the back of your mind that one in three hundred you'll get a job offer, the less you, if you start veering off right now you actually are decreasing your chances of getting a job. It's just a low hit rate. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N203DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560312\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203DC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203DD\">Like imagine the pigeon hitting the And every three hundred times, one in three hundred, it's going to go off and you'll get the food pellet. So if it stops pecking it's definitely not going to get the food pellet. (laughs) But it's very, very, very, very infrequent reinforcement. And I think that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203DD1\">part of what's happening. You're used to doing something and something happens. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203DE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203DF\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203E0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203E1\">THERAPIST: You know, right? Cause and effect. Immediate effect of your action. You go clean, it's clean. (laughs) So this is really hard to kind of persist and know that the reinforcement will come, but it's very, very infrequent reinforcement. I just think that those are the facts. So the more you <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203E11\">can start challenging the thought of, \"It's hopeless,\" with, I don't know what you would replace that with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203E2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203E3\">It has an effect. Everything I do might have an affect but I just don't know which one is going to have an effect. And you're also giving yourself days off where you're not -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203E4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203E5\">CLIENT: I am because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203E6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203E7\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203E8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203E9\">CLIENT: it's like after spending hours on the computer -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203EA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203EB\">THERAPIST: (cross talking at 00:44:37)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203EC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203ED\">CLIENT: it's like I just can't be on the computer any more. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203EE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Do you think it would help you, Ramona, to have something part time that you were doing? And I mean that specifically around, forget even money, let's say you had money. Would it help you to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203F0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203F1\">CLIENT: I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203F2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203F3\">THERAPIST: restructure to have something to go do part time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203F4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203F5\">CLIENT: So every Monday I go spend five hours to volunteer on that study.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203F6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203F7\">THERAPIST: Oh you do? Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203F8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203F9\">CLIENT: And now Yeah, I do. The thing is other people get paid to do exactly what I'm doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203FA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203FB\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203FC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203FD\">CLIENT: But by the time I joined the study I feel like she's out of grant money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203FE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203FF\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20400\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20401\">CLIENT: So I'm not getting fifteen dollars an hour, I'm getting nothing. (laughs) It's just frustrating but it's good for my resume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20402\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20403\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20404\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20405\">CLIENT: And now Friday I start orientation for patient advocacy at Walter Reed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20406\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20407\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20408\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20409\">CLIENT: Which is something I'm interested in. I'm interested in patient navigation which is pretty related, but that's also volunteer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2040A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2040B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2040C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2040D\">CLIENT: But I've been told by one of my professors that you've got to be at least volunteering. You will go crazy if you just do nothing but apply to jobs. So I'm hoping, like it can't hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2040E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2040F\">THERAPIST: It's building your resume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20410\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20411\">CLIENT: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20412\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20413\">THERAPIST: It's going to help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20414\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20415\">CLIENT: And hopefully I'll make some connections. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20416\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20417\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20418\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20419\">CLIENT: Yeah. If nothing else it's adding and it's giving me something to get out of the apartment and feel productive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2041A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2041B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Also telling yourself, a year from now you'll be somewhere. I know that's a long ways away, but it will happen. I think that's also with Ivan. Something is going to happen. And enough will happen that you will feel better, or nothing will happen and you will feel worse. But you'll know <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2041B1\">more in a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2041C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2041D\">This is the hardest time ever. So try to take a deep breath and just trust that something is going to happen and you're not going to be in this place forever. And every little thing you do might be the thing that gets you in the door somewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N2041C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2041C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560312\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2041E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2041F\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20420\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20421\">THERAPIST: If you get sick of it give yourself a day off.
