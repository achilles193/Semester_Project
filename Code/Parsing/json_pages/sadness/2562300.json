You\u2019re sexy. Right now you\u2019re not sexy, you\u2019re amusing.  (long pause) I happen to know that you think that I\u2019m incredibly sexy, which is why it\u2019s more funny than sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s good. [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:54) that\u2019s something you happen to know.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Did you have a good weekend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: It was okay. I was sick part of last week and I sort of came back over [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:53). It was fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I was your last one [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:59) in the hospital.  (pause) Or not [ ].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: The person who was in the hospital was fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Then I\u2019ll stop asking about that person. (long pause) It\u2019s a pretty ridiculous dynamic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: One thing that struck me about that and I don\u2019t know what to do with it is that you haven\u2019t thought of the possibility that it could have been a patient.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I don\u2019t know what your patients are like. (pause) And the way the transference is working is that there is so much that comes up around family and I\u2019m sort of letting it just take over. (pause)  I guess it\u2019s pretty unpalatable to me to go down that road of if it\u2019s a patient, are <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">there patients who need you more than I do? I hope so, but then also I really don\u2019t hope so or I really hope not. Are there patients whose call you would take and you would call them back when it\u2019s time to see me? Same thing in combination; and I guess I don\u2019t think I would call you on my way to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">hospital.  (pause) But I don\u2019t know. It hasn\u2019t happened yet. (pause) I guess it brings up a relationship with a patient that makes me feel bad to think about, so I guess that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t gone there.  It\u2019s conflicted. (long pause)  I guess there\u2019s a lot there. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: First of all, maybe I\u2019m missing something, but it seems to me that one thing to me you\u2019re not thinking about because you don\u2019t want to is, if somebody is having a mental health crisis, they might call me on their way to the hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: That was on your mind? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was on my mind. (pause) It\u2019s really [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:23). (pause) I think it makes me very scared (pause) that that exists.  (pause) But still, let\u2019s say I was having \u2013 the closest thing I could think of is some very debilitating panic attack and I went to the hospital. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\"> The way that you help me is not the way that I would want to be helped in the moment. Something like that. I guess what I\u2019m saying is I really don\u2019t need tough love in that moment, but I haven\u2019t really had something like that and called you for it, so I don\u2019t know that maybe your response would be different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I see. The tough part is . . ? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: A lot of space, not [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:13), no hugs, no reassuring things just to be reassuring \u2013 stuff that parents and spouses do. \u201cI love you; you\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: So at your worst or most frightened moment, I\u2019m at my most clinical at that moment? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562300\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s clinical. I think there is a lot of intimacy there between us during moments when I\u2019m feeling very, very fragile and you\u2019re giving me a lot of space and still holding it \u2013 holding me, holding it. I guess what feels like tough love is the space and I guess I\u2019m used to the sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">of smothering love where there is no space and you just get told and it often feels good.  So I guess I can\u2019t imagine in a crisis that, the way that I felt. I can\u2019t imagine you being a different way, but maybe you would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I see. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Also, I\u2019m sure there are ways to have a relationship with you where the relationship isn\u2019t such a big part of the relationship. In that case, I\u2019m sure that it would be just way simpler to pick up the phone and call you and something that I wouldn\u2019t think twice about and that I would just want, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">like any other person that I love. But sometimes, the relationship takes up most of the space and it\u2019s hard to act or say the things I want to say. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">People go to the hospital for mental health crises very different from acute anxiety-related events, so that\u2019s another thing that I\u2019m not thinking about. (long pause)  When my friend, Fernando, went to [Hoag] (ph?) that was a very different sort of crisis. (pause) Then the thought keeps coming up that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">if somebody really had the relationship with you like this, then it is possible that a mental-health crisis would stop; and that\u2019s na\u00efve and I\u2019m not quite sure why that keeps coming up, but it is. It\u2019s like well, there is something so healing here, so holding and so protective.  And I actually feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">like I have it and I guess it feels like it saved me, like Allison saved Jeremy or Jeremy saved Allison. Maybe not like that at all. I don\u2019t know. So what\u2019s the deal with other patients?  (long pause) I suppose I feel a little disillusioned. (pause) The potential for cure seems so [fast] (ph?) here <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200333\">and if somebody is going to the hospital, what does that mean?  What does that mean about you and them? What does that mean about them? What does that mean about you and me? I guess I\u2019m afraid on your end you\u2019re thinking people have got it way worse than you \u2013 or I\u2019m afraid that you\u2019re thinking that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200334\">(pause) Sometimes I feel, in general, like the worse I feel I feel a little relieved because I deserve you more.  Or like this hospital patient deserves you a lot more than I do; and yet your relationship with them is a caring one, so what\u2019s that about? Maybe there is no [ ] (inaudible at 00:23:47). <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200335\">I don\u2019t know anything. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s big, scary stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)  My grandfather\u2019s wound opening is getting real intense real fast as a result of his . . . I think he\u2019s still listening to the series that my dad got him that started my mom in meditation practice, so I\u2019m not sure how much he\u2019s doing it. My mom called me on Friday and told me [ <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">] is really, really, really upset often. He was weeping and weeping for his son yesterday. He was very agitated and very upset. This is my dad\u2019s brother who committed suicide.  She called and she was like, \u201cIs this supposed to happen?\u201d There was some question, like is this supposed to be happening? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">I think she just wanted to talk about it because it really upset my mom and my dad. I was so obnoxiously self-righteous in my response. I was like, \u201cThis is a painful process, mom. Yeah, that\u2019s supposed to be happening. What do you expect? You sit and things come up and you let them come up. I\u2019m sure <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200373\">there is a lot more where that came from.\u201d  Then later on I was like, \u201cI bet if you sat dad down, both he and [ ] (inaudible at 00:27:15) . . .\u201d They seem to have the same coping mechanism. Anyway, I think I managed to be soft enough where I wasn\u2019t being a total bitch. (pause) He\u2019s mourning a lot and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200374\">I made it clear that my mom and dad are super, super important in helping him and carrying him when it seems like he needs to be carried.  Also, if it\u2019s really painful, then sometimes it\u2019s like he\u2019s not going to go back to it. I don\u2019t know how to balance the [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:17) or curiosity <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200375\">in the container part of it with the stuff that comes up inside, to loosen, let go a little bit, practice [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:35) I don\u2019t think so, but you could check.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562300\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">[ ] (inaudible at 00:28:54) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: I asked how he was doing the next day and mom said that he is very grateful that he\u2019s meeting his [ ] and he feels good about his practice. (pause) It came up just now because my parents \u2013 I don\u2019t think my dad would have reacted this way; I\u2019m sure he\u2019s scared to \u2013 but my mom is really, really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">scared that he might fall into a depression. She kept saying that she wanted to know if it is because of the meditation or if he keeps falling into a depression for some other reason. I was like, \u201cHe might fall into a depression. Look how much stuff he has in his life.\u201d But it was like \u201cmaybe he should <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B2\">stop.\u201d  She really listened to me, so it wasn\u2019t forceful. She was really frightened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">Bringing up my uncle who committed suicide in the first place \u2013 how much fear was there? How much shame was there, even in a different part of the country in medical school? It\u2019s sort of what you did. You sent your kids all over and you saw your kids in summer. That\u2019s what my dad and his sister did, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">too. And they lost another sibling, that uncle and a fourth; there was a fourth that I just learned about two weeks ago, Polly, who died when she was two. I had never heard about her. She died of diphtheria.  So it started out with four and now it\u2019s two. (pause) My grandfather is 89 and I\u2019m sure the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D2\">mourning just never ends when you lose a child [ ] (inaudible at 00:32:31). He didn\u2019t mourn, but he and my dad are both haunted by nightmares about my uncle. I\u2019ve never heard them talk about him or his death. It seems like there is a lot stored up or something.  I think about the patient calling on <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D3\">the way to the hospital and what it might have been like for him, if it were completely different. (pause)  There is also the sense that [he] is 89. We don\u2019t want to disrupt his life too much; he\u2019s fragile. I had a different view on it. \u201cMom, he\u2019s preparing to die finally. This is probably okay. This <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D4\">is probably going to be fine for him. It might be very freeing.\u201d (pause)  So I imagine what the reaction might be to a mental health crisis hospital trip in my family, if it would be similar to what the reaction is to my grandfather\u2019s intensity in what he\u2019s feeling or [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:24), but <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D5\">I don\u2019t really know what the reaction was because I wasn\u2019t there. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562300\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: And then I think you also worry. I guess it seems to me like there is a small echo of some of the worries your mom has in your thoughts about me or you not being able to be [ ] (inaudible at 00:36:51). (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Like [afraid of] (ph?) the hospital patient? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: Or I guess in a way for you as you worried that moment would be between you and me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s more worrisome that I couldn\u2019t imagine calling you because it might upset you more in that behavioral crisis, but that\u2019s the thing I struggle with all the time.  Would I have gotten in touch with you between sessions? There is always that same loop and usually I decide that it helps <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">me more just to call you or to talk to you, but there is somehow [ ] (inaudible at 00:38:54) in the way before I reach that position because I\u2019m so sensitive to it.  (long pause)  Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: Okay.
