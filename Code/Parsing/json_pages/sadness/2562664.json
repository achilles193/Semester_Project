Come on in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">(Long silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: This is what I was thinking. (Sneezes) That what we talked about on Monday, like valuing others and undervaluing myself. (Pause) I guess I was wondering if my relationship with Chris (sp?) didn\u2019t work out because I started undervaluing myself. That was the biggest reason. Not that there has <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">to be just one reason, but I guess in terms of understanding something, understanding is (inaudible at 00:06:48). I\u2019m sure there are more reasons. (Chuckles) I guess I was trying to see if that\u2019s what happened those three years that I wasn\u2019t (ph) in good shape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">I don\u2019t know. Maybe the more important questions is \u201cWhy I undervalue myself?\u201d (Chuckles) Why that keeps happening. I guess that\u2019s kind of what I was trying to understand last time, but next to a lot of bright and shiny objects, that\u2019s why I find myself too dull in comparison. I guess we also talked <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">about why is there a need to compare in the first place.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I guess, you know, my rational answer really is that\u2019s how you understand the world and your place in it. So that\u2019s how you understand why you have what you have, and why you don\u2019t have what you don\u2019t have, and what others have. Obviously you\u2019re going to desire things that you don\u2019t have so you try <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">to get them and you fail. I guess what that\u2019s abstract [more than anything] (ph). Maybe I should talk more about my own specific situation. (Chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: When you say, \u201cThat\u2019s how.\u201d What\u2019s how? What are you referring to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: You said, \u201cThat\u2019s how you know your place in the world.\u201d When you say \u201cThat\u2019s how,\u201d what\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Well, you compare and you like, hierarchize and place yourself in comparison to others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s not something that you compare, which I think is a problem in many respects, but that you\u2019re always in the unfavorable position.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, it\u2019s logistically the case. Right? Yesterday at school I\u2019m sitting and eating lunch with Chris (sp?) and his friend and both are professors and I\u2019m a student in the same institution. And I\u2019m complaining about my bill that I haven\u2019t paid. I don\u2019t have\u2026 $300 is too much for me. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">that\u2019s just logistically the case. Obviously I\u2019m going to feel small next to these guys who are constantly just talking about tenure and how this person makes $90,000 but this other person makes $110,000 because he was hired five years later. You know? And then they close the difference of 15 (ph). <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">So it\u2019s all there. It\u2019s not just in my head. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know how that relates to anything though. You\u2019re making it mean something that I don\u2019t really understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: But what does that say about anything? What does it say that you\u2019re a student? Why does that reflect anything on you? Bad, good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It makes me feel small and makes me not want to sit at the same table with them. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: But you chose this. You already have 2 masters. You already have the degree that you\u2019re pursuing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I had my reasons doing this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I know. But then you\u2019re saying that, \u201cI\u2019m only a lowly student.\u201d Well, you chose to get a third masters.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562664\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: (Chuckles) I know that.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m putting that out that you do have things that these other people, at least some of the things that these other people do have and can get the things that these people have. But somehow that just kind of gets washed away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: What gets washed away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: The fact that you do have degrees already and you could be making more money if you wanted to. You\u2019re just choosing not to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. I know that. (Chuckles) (Pause) I don\u2019t know. It just makes me want to run and hide. (Laughs) That\u2019s like my first reaction. Only reaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: If you feel you\u2019re at a point in life that you don\u2019t want to be a student anymore, that you want to have a different status, you could choose that too. You certainly don\u2019t need to be a student anymore if you don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re getting a degree you absolutely need to get and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">you\u2019re just sort of very low on the ladder because of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I guess what you\u2019re saying is, \u201cLook at how lowly I am, given how much more status and stature these other people have,\u201d and I\u2019m sort of saying, \u201cQuit complaining and just go get it then.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Chuckles<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: If it\u2019s that important to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I\u2019m also trying to tell myself that this decision has given me so much more time to write, which I didn\u2019t have earlier, which I was dying for. So I should remember that and I should remember every day. Every day that I am writing. And I do. I make a note on my calendar, \u201cI wrote <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">these many hours.\u201d I should just constantly keep looking at that. And yet, coming out of (inaudible at 00:15:26) and all, but I chose it for a reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">That\u2019s what Chris (sp?) tells me. \u201cYou gave yourself three years so just stick with that.\u201d I\u2019m thankful for this advice, but then I\u2019m also thanking you (ph). And any time you talk about how much this person, that person is making I just go and shut my ears and ignore you. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Do you feel that he\u2019s preoccupied with how much people make?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I feel like I know him pretty well and he\u2019s not at all money-minded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: You do bring about a lot that you guys talk about peoples\u2019 salaries, which people do talk about that but it\u2019s not like something that\u2019s very common that people talk about often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, but I think he was just kind of find out that it matters when you get hired. That was the context. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: That your starting salary matters?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. That if you\u2019re hired 5 years later, [maybe somehow and you] (ph) negotiate well. He would write me a check for however much I ask him for in the sense that he doesn\u2019t care about money. He\u2019s not like Nelson (sp?). You know? Who is totally like that. (Laughs) (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">Yeah. I just have to live with this narrative until something changes. Until I graduate or find a job. Because it does suck to not be with money, to not have money when everyone around me does. It\u2019s a daily or monthly struggle. (Laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Well, even if people around you don\u2019t, you need a certain amount to live on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I can take care of myself, so\u2026 (Sighs) Whatever. It\u2019s temporary. I keep telling myself that. It\u2019s temporary. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">The other thing\u2014a gap in the bridge between these two. The other thing I want to talk about was what makes people attractive. What makes me attractive of those and what makes others attractive to me? I wanted to understand a little bit more about my, I guess, sexuality or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562664\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s an important topic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it is subjective. It changes from time to time. I guess I still feel like I can hear my friend\u2019s voice saying, \u201cYou\u2019re a destructive maul (ph).\u201d I don\u2019t know what exactly her context was with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">This was around the time I kind of seemed ornery (ph) or something. I guess I associate that with being destructive. That going for someone I\u2019m attracted to physically is destructive and giving up stability and love and care for someone I\u2019m attracted to, that is supposed to be destructive. (Laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Is that what you felt she was saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m sure she wasn\u2019t saying that, but that\u2019s what I heard. Like, I have this narrative in my head that Chris (sp?) is great. He\u2019s upright and he\u2019s upstanding; he\u2019s moral and he\u2019s kind. I love him. He loves me. Just quit complaining as you were saying earlier and be with him. (Pause) And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">that, just like the rebel in me is like, \u201cNo. If I\u2019ll be with him, I won\u2019t sleep with him.\u201d Or I just, \u201cOh, find him attractive.\u201d Which pretty much is what happens all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">And then I\u2019m like, \u201cAm I a sadist? Do I like people who are kind of narcissistic, or like are mean to me? Or like, you know\u2026 Yeah, so it\u2019s all like he\u2019s weird now (inaudible at 00:22:12). (Pause) Yeah, I kind of understand why I don\u2019t find Chris (sp?) attractive, especially since he\u2019s so kind and nice. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">Like, does that turn me off? (Chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">[Long Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking about? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Just what more to say about this? (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Well, in a very broad way you\u2019re trying to figure out whether that some of the things that you find attractive or don\u2019t, whether they\u2019re changeable or not. You know, whether it\u2019s sort of your mindset about your not finding men attractive because he\u2019s too kind to you or something that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">can work through versus you know, some people are just less attractive to people; and I guess you can find your reason for it but it\u2019s not exactly anything that you can change. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: What can you not change?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Attraction for example. It\u2019s an interesting question. Is there a way in which we can understand some of the things that do and don\u2019t attract other people that are changeable because they\u2019re based on conflict or whatever? Versus just some people you just find attractive or not. Even if we <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">find a reason for it, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re either attracted to them or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">But it\u2019s sort of an undertone to a lot or subtext to a lot of what you say. Especially with Chris (sp?). Maybe if you just felt differently about x, y, or z, then you\u2019d have a different feeling toward him in general. You ask yourself that a lot. And they\u2019re good questions. I certainly don\u2019t know the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">answers to them, but they\u2019re good questions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean\u2026 because ultimately or soon I feel like I should make a decision about whether [ph] I want to spend the rest of my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: You may not have met the person you should spend the rest of your life with.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562664\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Well, I\u2019ve not much time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the time limitation? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve known Chris (sp?) for 10 years now. His parents have been asking about marriage for a long time now. I made the excuse, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to finish my book first.\u201d Well, that might be happening soon too so then what\u2019s my excuse then? I feel like I could see myself married and having children. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">That requires that I make a commitment to one person. (Laughs) I\u2019m like so far from doing that with Chris because things are so up in the air. I\u2019m involved with someone else and not just involved as like, \u201cYeah, we see each other,\u201d but actually have feelings for him too. I feel like, marriage wise, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200832\">things are muddled (ph).  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">So I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to understand if this is changeable. If something in my head changes, I\u2019ll find Chris (sp?) attractive, you know? (Pause) Like, one aspect definitely, is when I, last year, was living with him and things with (inaudible 00:30:37) were over but I was kind of still thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">about him. But overall I feel like that things were in control and Chris and I were kind of okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">Still there were moments when I would just really desire craziness? I don\u2019t know what else to call it. Because he\u2019s so mellow and mild. I would desire crazy highlights (ph) that I\u2019ve never really had experienced until now. (Laughs) Going to bars and drinking and meeting random people or dancing or whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">and getting drunk. I had never done that in my 20s and I just always had this image of (inaudible at 00:31:36) curiosity of, \u201cWhat is that like?\u201d (Chuckles) It\u2019s funny that I\u2019m getting to see all that now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">Certain evenings I would just get drunk by myself. [He might run] (ph) away or something. I would just cry a lot when he would get back and he would be like, \u201cWhat are you done? What are you doing?\u201d (Laughs) I would wonder if that is very pathetic. Like, me doing that. I\u2019d look at myself from above <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">and be like, \u201cThat\u2019s pathetic. Why am I doing that?\u201d Again, my friend\u2019s voice would get in my head. \u201cYou\u2019re in a destructive phase (ph).\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like that wasn\u2019t only your friend\u2019s voice; that your mother used to tell you that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) I would just say, \u201cYou\u2019re just not satisfied with me. You\u2019re just not satisfied sexually (ph) or whatever.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not like that. [I\u2019m like a pretty mild guy] (ph). I\u2019m perfectly happy staying at home cooking a meal and that\u2019s it.\u201d No, I hate that. I want to do crazy things. (Laughs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">I guess now that I am doing those crazy things, as in like Nelson (sp?) is social and likes to go out and grab a drink sometimes and meet his friends for drinks. One of his friends was like really crazy and we go to his place and he makes us drinks and we dance until really late at night and that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D2\">something I\u2019ve always wanted to do. It\u2019s like a safe place and you\u2019re just dancing with people you consider friends and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s kind of like the thrill I\u2019ve always wanted and never had until now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">(inaudible at 00:34:19) I look forward to nights where I\u2019m watching TV and not doing much, you know? So, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s destructive. I really wanted to understand why was I seeking that out last year when I didn\u2019t have it. Getting drunk by myself and surprising or scaring Chris <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">(laughs). I guess that\u2019s the piece I want to understand. Is that changeable or not changeable? Can I base my life on it? If I marry Chris then, what if all of a sudden I feel so locked and I\u2019m like \u201cWhere are those crazy nights. I want them and I cannot take this mellow night after night, every night, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F2\">every day.\u201d What if that happens? I\u2019m capable of anything. What will I do? You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562664\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: How do you mean you\u2019re capable of anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: No, I mean. I don\u2019t know. What if I do something really stupid? I don\u2019t even know what that means. It\u2019s just [inaudible at 00:35:41].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">Or is it just me? Me seeking extreme kind of situations. Not really even that (ph) extreme (chuckles). (Pause) Certain other friends who are not really like, I don\u2019t associate them with being crazy or anything. They\u2019re pretty stable and married and all that. And they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, I really look forward <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">to my drinks, my alcohol like every Friday afternoon. [We go] (ph) writing and we\u2019re working hard and really look forward to that relief [ph].\u201d When I say that I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, so someone like Nelson (sp?) is better for me than someone like Chris because he\u2019s all, \u201cStay at home.\u201d You know. Be mild. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">I guess this all just relating to my \u201cWho I find attractive and why.\u201d (Pause) I mean it\u2019s kind of sad sometimes that I feel like I can\u2019t share stuff with Nelson (sp?) the way that I can with Chris, the way that I can cry in front of Chris. [I can contain all that] (ph) When I\u2019m feeling sad or depressed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">I can\u2019t really talk to Nelson (sp?) about it. I just don\u2019t want to or I feel like he\u2019s not paying attention and he actually might not be paying attention. I\u2019d rather talk about silly, happy things with him. [Again, that scares me] (ph). How would this work out long term? But then I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200972\">been supportive in the past.\u201d He cries. So maybe there\u2019s something that, you know\u2026 (Pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">I have these associations and they\u2019re\u2026there\u2019s a dichotomy (ph) there perhaps? I think when I\u2019m drinking or when I\u2019m drunk I see Nelson (sp?) as I associate him with craziness or attractiveness or whatever. And then when I\u2019m like scared about my writing or \u201cWhat\u2019s the next step? I can\u2019t see the next <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">step. It\u2019s all darkness.\u201d I\u2019m like reaching out for Chris. (Chuckles) Which I guess would be totally fine if both of them were friends, you know? And in many ways they are. They were here. They both said, \u201cYeah. We\u2019re your friend.\u201d (Pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">Yeah, I guess in my head sex is associated with craziness. It\u2019s not associated with safe and warm and comforting and loving. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: I imagine it\u2019s associated with your dad\u2019s exploits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: No, I hope it isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to go there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: But the idea that it\u2019s crazy, I mean, it can be. But that it can\u2019t be other things too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: No. I don\u2019t know. I was with Chris for so long. And I loved him and he loved me but it never really translated to, \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s have sex.\u201d You know? And then I had my whatever, sexual awakening [ph] and I had been with Graham (sp?) and then [inaudible] and been with like Oliver (sp?) and having <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">sex. Feeling the need for it for the first time. And I tried to bring that feeling back to Chris and we did but it was mechanical, I guess? I haven\u2019t really been able to\u2026 \u201cOkay. Safe, warm, comforting, loving sex.\u201d It just doesn\u2019t follow. It\u2019s like dangerous, dark, and unknown. You know, scary sex? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562664\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s what I was suggesting. That there\u2019s an association of sex and your dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I hope not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: What do you mean, \u201cWhy not?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Why hope not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Oh, because then I would just totally run away from it because what I associate with him and his exploits is that he hurt my mom. He\u2019s an asshole to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s all the association but I think that\u2019s some of it. You\u2019re worried that your sexual needs will lead you astray and lead you away from what you really should have. And that\u2019s good. And you sort of see kind of a dichotomy at times between your sexual needs and being in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B11\">loving or stable or constructive relationship. I do think there are those associations for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) I don\u2019t know what to do about them. (Pause) Well, I mean I do have a fear that I\u2019m like him. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to be like him. You know, obviously being with Chris makes me feel like, I don\u2019t know like, it\u2019s all safe and comforting and I just feel locked in that and I wonder <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B31\">if that\u2019s what my dad felt when he did it. (Pause) Yeah. I don\u2019t know why I feel if I was locked in so much with Chris. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">Like it\u2019s safe and boring, I\u2019m like, \u201cNo. Really. No. No. No.\u201d But with Nelson (sp?)\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m trying to understand what I like and don\u2019t like. I feel like beyond doubt I\u2019m attracted to him. There\u2019s no doubt in that. That\u2019s like what you were saying earlier. Changing or unchanging. I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">that\u2019s unchanging, at least for now. But he\u2019s not very experienced or sexual or you know. So most nights, he\u2019s not here most nights anyways, but it\u2019s not like every single night we have sex. It\u2019s not like that. Earlier, I wasn\u2019t okay with that because I was in a different place. But now I\u2019m more okay <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B52\">with just like falling asleep next to him or doing nice things for him. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m locked in because we\u2019re so far from making any kind of commitment but I don\u2019t resent being locked in like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:46:23) need to stop for today.
