Congratulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Thank you. Probably about three months ago. Thank you. Did you notice it before or did you just notice recently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I noticed at the beginning of January.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah. November. It was sometime in November.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I\u2019m very happy for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: We had two sessions in the same week last time I saw you. Did they feel very different to you from each other?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Not from previous sessions. Did they feel different from each other?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Meaning those two sessions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Those two sessions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Not to me. Not noticeably different than comparing the other sessions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s no real variation in sessions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t think those two sessions were dramatically different from the two other sessions we might pick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Did they feel different to you though?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. So, I went home and I slept for the next two days. I was pretty sick at our second sessions last week. (pause) It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t feel that it was useful. I just felt like it was very different over here and I was kind of curious about how different it felt over there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: It was different because we met twice or because you were sick?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Because I was sick. Yeah. No. The day felt very different to me because I felt like I couldn\u2019t engage further at a certain point. (pause) You start shutting down the external systems or the least necessary systems first to maintain power in the core or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It didn\u2019t strike me. I mean I knew you weren\u2019t feeling well, but it probably felt more different than you, from your perspective because you were the one not feeling well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Okay. Just curious. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Thanks. Me too. It was just a cold. I slept it off. (Silence from 00:04:50 to 00:05:35)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">Yeah, I felt that session was interesting. There were two points that sort of stand out now. One was sort of suggested that my mother was lost when I was growing up and that may have had some effect. That was a very interesting suggestion. I\u2019m still am not exactly sure how to engage with it. I thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200531\">it was very interesting though. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">The other was I sort of, I said something like I didn\u2019t need an advisor when I came to Illinois which I don\u2019t think that I actually believe that. I think that\u2019s actually symptomatic of the mental state I was in. It\u2019s like I think you won\u2019t be surprised to say that I desperately want an advisor, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200551\">if I\u2019m told I can\u2019t have it, then I don\u2019t need that anyway. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s sort of like a shell to protect the desires or something like that. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">I felt like some of those walls were up during our session last week and I guess I\u2019m not surprised to hear you say well, that\u2019s not unusual in our sessions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: You felt more walls were up?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562684\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, but not all of them were up, so I felt like we still had productive conversations and I wasn\u2019t hiding anything in particular. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019m protecting other than I couldn\u2019t chase down things when you sort of were bringing them up if that makes sense. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: You were very aware of feeling different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes. (Silence from 00:07:52 to 00:08:52) Tanya has been self-injuring again. She had cuts on her thighs, so that\u2019s happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Did she stop for a while and then just start?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yes. Yeah and it kind of comes and goes. It\u2019s more present recently. She\u2019s also been suicidal off and on in the last couple of weeks, like three weeks or so. So, yes. I was sick and you saw me and then that weekend she was, I was better, but she was suicidal and kind of not as bad as it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">this time last year, but suicidal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">I don\u2019t know. By Tuesday, it was sort of gone again. It\u2019s like as Dr. Jannis (sp?) suggested, this is a very common pattern when things start to get better and then the suicidal ideation comes back. Part of, it\u2019s part of the healing process or something. It\u2019s plausible. It\u2019s plausible that\u2019s what\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200651\">going on in this case. I certainly believe him that that\u2019s a thing he has seen before that is commonly observed, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Are you skeptical?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Not of, again, not of that being a common pattern, but I\u2019m skeptical of any single interpretation of Tanya\u2019s illness or a projection of what the future will look like. (Silence from 00:11:15 to 00:12:00)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Are you worried?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: (pause) Not, I don\u2019t know. Not any more than normal, I guess. I guess I\u2019ve been something like afraid that she\u2019s going to die or is going to continue in this pattern indefinitely. For long enough that or she might die now is not particularly scary. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">That\u2019s not exactly true. The other feature about fears, I mean we\u2019ve talked about fears some, but it\u2019s probably the emotion I have the most difficult time recognizing in myself. Even more so than other emotions, my response to fear is to suppress it or I like the word crush because fear is a thing that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">stops you from doing what needs to be done. These are things you need. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">I\u2019ve dealt with it, but not by like spending a lot of time in it or overcoming it or eliminating it. I know you actually asked are you worried, but that seemed related or it did when I started to answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: So, fearing that fear can be paralyzing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry. Can you say that again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Fear that fear can be paralyzing. You said something that needs to be crushed that prevents you from doing what you need to be done is a fear that fear can be paralyzing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: (Laughter) Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what came to my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: The maybe was not meant to be dismissive. It was more like you\u2019re suggesting like second order fear of fear itself. It\u2019s part of the discussions I have, I think, a very developed ability to crush it. Second order. Probably. I was talking to my friend, Cody, who I played volleyball with in college. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D1\">He\u2019s been doing tai-chi recently, so he\u2019s kind of drifted from martial art to martial art. Tai-chi is different from the ones he\u2019s ever done, so he said he was standing there with this relatively elderly master and he said push on my chest, so Cody did. Then he said now stop pushing on my chest. Cody <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D2\">said okay, I can do that and stopped and the guy said no, really, stop pushing on my chest. So, they did that for about five minutes before Cody finally figured out how to stop pushing on his chest. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562684\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">I can\u2019t remember exactly what the master said to him, but it was something like you don\u2019t have to be afraid of that and Cody said his response was I\u2019m not afraid internally and then he said oh, no, I\u2019m terrified. So, I feel like that\u2019s... I understood that experience I think, although that moment of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">realization of I\u2019m terrified is a difficult one to find. Sorry. You\u2019re looking at me very intently. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: I mean it was a striking thing that you said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: It\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mind you looking intently. I just found it amusing in that moment. It\u2019s sort of like imagining when you\u2019re looking at me that intently it\u2019s like I\u2019m wondering what you are thinking about. I feel like I look at things intently when I\u2019ve found a really interesting problem or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: I was thinking about terrified in particular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a good word. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">Yeah. I can\u2019t remember the source, but I saw a suggestion recently that lack of trust is fear which I think we have talked about in some ways before, but it\u2019s sort of (pause) I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s really strictly a one to one thing. It sounded about right which would suggest that I have a lot of fear because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">I don\u2019t trust a whole lot of things. (Silence from 00:19:50 to 00:20:50)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I started thinking that about blind trust and how that\u2019s sort of a product of fear too. You know, like I started thinking like you were describing how the leader of the organization said don\u2019t read this, don\u2019t read that. That not reading that is a symptom of fear too, because you\u2019re afraid <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">of what you\u2019re going to learn. So, there\u2019s a blind trust. The blindness is, I guess, the fear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s really interesting. How much space is there in the middle? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">Yeah, it\u2019s really helpful. Cody talked about, so Cody and I are friends for a lot of reasons. One of them is that we just have a very similar world view and that\u2019s I think is constructed out of a lot of experiences that are similar, but at different times in our lives. He had a near death experience <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">his freshman year of college. I was like a sophomore in high school at the time. So, he\u2019s a few years older than I am. I think that trauma shook him in some ways, but more particularly here, we both have a sort of strong awareness of our circumstances that surround us. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">You know, some people will walk anywhere in a city at any time of day in a blind trust that everything will be okay. Some people are more alert and some people are perhaps hyper alert. We straddle that line, I think between alert and hyper alert which maybe means we\u2019re far in to the hyper alert section <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">and unwilling to admit that. I\u2019m not really sure. He was suggesting in talking about that anecdote that I just told you that this was a thing that was just like really deep seeded in his family. He\u2019s got an 8 month old son now and so he said, you know, visiting his grandfather with his son, his grandfather <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200912\">who used to be an amateur boxer, talking about oh, he\u2019s got good hands. He\u2019s got good reflexes. He said that was cute the first time. It was kind of fun. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562684\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">After a while, it sort of struck Cody as odd. What a strange way to be interacting with a small child. It\u2019s like related to his own deep seeded fear or something at all times. His father moved from Texas, which is kind of on the coast to [], which is kind in the mountains. He bought a gun. They\u2019re all <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">very liberal pacifists, although they\u2019re also a little aggressive. It\u2019s this very weird thing for his father to have a gun. He said it\u2019s all about fear. That\u2019s very clearly why he did this. There\u2019s something about living in that part of the country that makes him uncomfortable, although, it\u2019s much safer <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200932\">than where they used to live. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">You\u2019re suggesting, so, I have sort of been saying this is obviously a deep seeded part of me also. It\u2019s one of the reasons that he and I are friends is that shared approach to the world. So, you suggesting that fear is a can come in the other direction as blind trust. My mother is terrified of a lot of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not surprised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: (Laughter) I didn\u2019t really think you would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I mean, it\u2019s very fitting of your description of her. I don\u2019t mean to judge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: No. That\u2019s okay. It really, you know, I\u2019m telling you because I sort of had a things came together realization that\u2019s worth sharing. It doesn\u2019t go much farther than that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">Somehow that all made sense at the same time. It\u2019s like yes, if we both grew up in environments where the adults around us are a particular kind of terrified or a particular kind of afraid, it makes sense that it would produce a similar response in us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: What kinds of things? When you say your mother was very, very fearful, what kinds of things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: So, it\u2019s a little bit hard because she has many of the same beliefs, but I think she is less fearful now than she was when she was younger in a lot of ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">In general, I think she\u2019s afraid of (pause) something like moral decay in America. Like, if we don\u2019t hold vigorously on to a very tight set of beliefs, everything will rot and that will cause, I don\u2019t know exactly what. Maybe the destruction of everything. America ceasing to be whatever it is that is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">good. That\u2019s sort of one thing which I guess many different specific fears are subsumed in to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Would the sort of outcome be kind of chaos? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Interesting. Either chaos or something like an authoritarian control by the wrong people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Like a cult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: No, those are the right people because you know you don\u2019t realize it\u2019s authoritarian, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Or you don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Well. You know, this is the thing, right? Most cults are built around some good premise with a whole lot of bad things. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t know that you would say that relationships are wrong, but you would say that abusive relationships are bad or I would hope that you would say something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">I don\u2019t know what I think about religion more generally, but cults have a tendency to be abusive religious organizations. You know, the people who are in the cult of anti-cultism might go so far as to say that all religions are cults in some way, but maybe that\u2019s the cult of that religion. It\u2019s very <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">complicated. So, like there are people who spend all of their time getting other people out of cults. That seem like it requires a very similar mindset to the people who are in the cults of just like undiluted commitment to the cause. It\u2019s not that I think that they\u2019re not doing good things necessarily. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B32\">I just think that at some point it drifts too far. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562684\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">Maybe now we\u2019ve drifted from talking about my mother to a particular fear about myself which is for the right cause, particularly when I was younger, I would do anything which I was younger a year or two ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: What comes to mind? Any specifics?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: About?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: When you said I would do anything for a particular cause.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: What comes to mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: I guess the most recent story; I can\u2019t remember which hospitalization it was. I think it was down in Englewood. That would have been maybe her second hospitalization. It felt like she went in on a Friday morning, like early in the morning and no one saw her on Friday. No one saw her on Saturday <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">or Sunday either. So, she has been there for three days. Knowing that the first time a large part of, she was out in three days because a large part of what was helpful was going there and there being another option. Things got done very quickly, so I felt like not only were they not treating her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">They were making it less likely that she would allow herself or decide to be hospitalized again which to me said they were making the large scale problem dramatically worse. If you close off that outlet, what is left? I thought briefly about whether it was necessary or useful to forcibly remove her from the premises.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Meaning the hospital?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, the secure ward of the hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Because then that option would then be, feel more feasible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: (Laughter) You know, I won\u2019t go so far as to say that there was a, it was more like this is not helping. She needs to not be here than a yeah. I think there are a lot of good reasons that I didn\u2019t do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I understand this wasn\u2019t like okay, now I\u2019m going to do this because this is a great idea. You were talking about an idea that you had. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: It was definitely an idea. You know. She needs to be out. It will take three days if she signs a release to get out. Maybe I should light the hospital on fire and then go take her. I think before the question you had stopped me, well, that would probably hurt a lot of other people. Not worth <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">it. That stopped me. Anyway. That\u2019s just the first one that comes to mind. I have no idea how that strikes you, but (pause) I guess I want to impress on you that if I had not had one or more objections, I could have done it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">If I had believed more firmly that would be helpful. I guess that\u2019s a major objection that I don\u2019t think that this is going to help in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: You were giving this example. If I remember this correctly, you were giving this as an example as sort of people who take people out of cults are can themselves sort of create a cult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: So, I guess I was trying to then put that together with what you were describing as an example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: Maybe that\u2019s why that particular example was fresh enough. You know, when I was younger, like 16 or something, I really felt like war was an important thing. I mean there are people who want to destroy your country. You have to go kill them. That belief horrifies me now. You know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562684\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">Maybe you\u2019ve read [] (sp?) or maybe you know something about the holocaust and one of the particularly horrifying features of the German people is that it was relatively easy to get them to do these horrible things by telling them that it was hard, but that it must be done. I\u2019m definitely, naturally, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">sensitive to that kind of argumentation. I think I have sufficient skepticism at this point in my life to not be that susceptible to it. It\u2019s not totally clear in this. All this thinking about the cult has sort of shaken it somewhat. Shaken me somewhat in the sense of like clearly it still has effects <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF2\">on my world view and belief structure, but I don\u2019t recognize all of them yet. I\u2019m sorry. That really has drifted to a lot of topics all at once. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I think they\u2019re all related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: They feel related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Because you started talking about fear and that of all of the emotions that are difficult for you, fear is really the most difficult. Then you started talking about how your mother was fearful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Well, you know, I had prompting, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Well, I didn\u2019t prompt you by saying by the way, is your mother fearful? I said blind trust.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Fair enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: You associated it to your mother being fearful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: Fair enough. Yes, I really did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Did you feel like I was pulling for is your mother fearful? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: No. Not at all. No. Not at all. I thought you were, you know, (pause) I don\u2019t know if the word pleased comes to mind, but that\u2019s not the right shade of meaning at that response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like I\u2019m looking for something? Do you feel like I\u2019m digging for something specific?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: So, I expect at this point that you have some set of theories about me because that\u2019s how I interact with the world. I expect you in some ways to be digging for evidence that supports or undermines those theories. Not in a, not in a like cherry picking evidence to confirm theories that are wrong, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F71\">but like actually probing for what\u2019s going on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: So, would I be pleased with that particular thing about your mother, per se or just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: In that case, I think, sometimes I also think that you, in your position of not being me, know different things about me than I know about myself. I also expect you to be pleased when I come to recognize something that you have already recognized, because I feel like that\u2019s part of why we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB1\">here. I think it was more that feature. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s interesting. I wouldn\u2019t have thought of that. I wouldn\u2019t have thought that was why you thought I\u2019d be pleased.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Oh. Okay. So, now I\u2019m curious. How far from how you approach this endeavor are my feelings about it from, how far apart are we on that subject?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: In terms of what you said about theories?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: I mean I was thinking about it that certainly a theory is a way or organizing information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">THERAPIST: Maybe even more accurately organizing experience. Information is a part of experience. Maybe that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know. I certainly think about, first of all, I think we\u2019re emotionally better off if we have a way of organizing experiences in a meaningful way. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20108-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20108-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562684\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">I mean if there\u2019s no organization to our experience, it\u2019s just, we just experience chaos. So, I think from the psychological perspective that we all need that. We need that process. Things just can\u2019t seem random. Our feelings are just, from one moment to the next, random and there needs to be a way. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">We need to have a way of organizing our experience psychologically and then certainly, in this endeavor, I think about my organizing my own experience of you and helping you to organize your experience. And to the more sort of not necessarily complexity to it, but the more meat to it, the better in <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B2\">a sense. If you have a very, not for the sake of embellishing, but if you have something that is very, very sparse, there\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s flimsy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah. You have very little explanatory power. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Certainly one way of organizing experience, which therapy gets a think rightfully bad rap is everything is attributable to one\u2019s childhood and there\u2019s a one to one correlation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">CLIENT: (Laughter).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: You feel this way because this happened. You feel this way because this happened. I don\u2019t ascribe to that at all. I think it\u2019s ridiculous. I do think what happens to us matters, even if it\u2019s because how we organize it retrospectively. I think all of our ways of organizing our experiences <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201131\">have to include something about our past, even if it\u2019s about our past reinterpreted. That\u2019s why I think that understanding what happened or your experiences itself is a bit of a misnomer because it\u2019s assuming that these thing happen and now you\u2019re understanding it retrospectively versus the understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201132\">as part of the organizing. I think that way about it. That was kind of a long winded answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: No. It was great. Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: Sure.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not really sure what to say in response to that. Thanks. I appreciate your sharing your views on the subject. I like them. I\u2019m not really surprised to find that I like them at this point because I feel like if I disliked them strongly what would have stopped us from meeting at some point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">I like the complexity too. The world is complex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Well, we do look at the .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: I felt like we were close to being out of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re close. That clock is like a couple minutes fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: Okay. (pause) Yeah, I don\u2019t have anything else to say now. I\u2019m sort of dealing with things. So, I\u2019m going to ask this. Do you feel happy and fulfilled in your life? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: That\u2019s fantastic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">THERAPIST: What brought up that question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just one of the questions that I have about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Did you have a thought of how I\u2019d answer that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">CLIENT: I hoped that you would say yes because I want you to be happy and fulfilled. On the other hand, if you really hated your life, I don\u2019t know that you would really tell me because I feel like you have a very high level professionalism. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">THERAPIST: So, it\u2019s not clear whether you would actually get an answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">CLIENT: I feel like I got an answer. You sort of, I don\u2019t know. Either you hate your life and really, really, really strongly suppress it, which I don\u2019t think is the case about you at all.
