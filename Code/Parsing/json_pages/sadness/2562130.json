I was really my brain was asleep or something on Monday. After that drive and I spoke to my mom, she said it\u2019s good that you went but I think that that trip always just makes you, gets to you more than you expect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">So interestingly I happened to be interviewing for the [inaudible at 00:00:42] assistant job and I got really angry when I got to work on Tuesday. I think it was just because I was there or something. But then with the first interview it was interesting actually. I was kind of not feeling it and totally <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">not, of friend of mine could kind of start and then I\u2019ll chime in after. But the girl that we were kind of asking about would you feel satisfied with it because she\u2019s an assistant coming from, trying to make a lateral move kind of from a different department within MIT. And we were kind of gauging <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">what she does when she starts to or I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember how the question was framed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">But anyway she\u2019s talking about how she feels that if she gets bored in her job she likes to know that she can go to development center, take a course and learn how to do things better. I don\u2019t know, just hearing her, a young person, talk about ways to make things interesting and develop their career <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">and whatever, kind of I don\u2019t know helped me think about my situation in a different light and that was helpful. Just kind of like yes I can go take courses if I wanted to, I could, I mean granted it\u2019s not the solution I want; I want a new job. But it was just kind of put things in perspective for me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">which was really helpful that morning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">Yes and so, and I met with oh, I know what happened actually. This is what happened. I was really, really, really angry just kind of seething and just slamming around. I got to my office at 9:15 on Tuesday and I realized on my way in that morning, I guess the subway ride made me angry too. I was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">cold and there was people whatever. And then I realized I had the appointment with Dr. Gillingham (ph) at 9:45, so I stomped over there, I was so mad. But I think even though it\u2019s not like I had a therapy session with him, he just kind of asked my how I\u2019m feeling and gives me a prescription and when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">we\u2019re going to check in next and whatever. I did say to him I\u2019m having a really angry morning, this, the Celexa\u2019s been helping with this but I find when it comes to my job it\u2019s hard for me to, it\u2019s hard to curtail those feelings. And I mean just kind of doing that helped me calm down a little bit and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">the walk I think. And then I had that nice interview with the girl who I hope gets hired. I really think she\u2019d be the ideal candidate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">We had three other interviews this week, one of which was with an internal person who is filling in for dammit, I thought I brought my coffee; maybe down there filling in for somebody who\u2019s at Basic Training in our department and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Did you want to check?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s probably in my [inaudible at 00:03:42]. Okay, that\u2019s the right position. Okay, whatever. And so they kind of want to give her a chance. She\u2019s, her English she\u2019s still kind of learning English, and the finance team is routing for her because they think she\u2019s been doing such a great job. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">I don\u2019t think she\u2019s been doing such a great job. I, from the jump, was I would be really nervous about hiring somebody who\u2019s English is so poor just in terms of the amount of writing that goes into this position and how I\u2019m really trying to move away from having somebody I need to micromanage and feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">like I would have to micromanage her even more than Melody (ph). I mean maybe some of the things she would be better at in terms of making sure supplies are ordered, making sure I think that I would have other issues such as typos and not being tech savvy enough and whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562130\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">Then I find out that she\u2019s fucked up reimbursements for a couple of students that needed the money in order to get home from abroad or something like that. Fucked up some reimbursements from the conference, like some presenters haven\u2019t been reimbursed from November and it\u2019s January; has twice sent me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">my corporate card report and when I click into it it\u2019s from 2012 or some random date. Which is small things but it\u2019s happened twice to me so I wonder how many other people this has happened to and I don\u2019t know. If that\u2019s really one of your only tasks right now, you shouldn\u2019t be fucking it up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">Then she comes to me, because I guess Melody (ph) was out of the office, and she said, an interview was coming in, and she said Matt is here to see you. And I said Matt? And I said is it Graham (ph)? And she said no, he said Matt. And I said I don\u2019t have any meetings scheduled with an Matt, and she <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">said well I don\u2019t know maybe it\u2019s Graham (ph). I said, you want this job, you tell me, you ask the person to repeat their name, you come and say Graham (ph) is here for his interview, I\u2019ve asked him if he\u2019d like some coffee and told him to wait. Should I let him know you know, if you want the job <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">act like you\u2019re doing the job already. And then she interviewed poorly and I think that Arvilla who I was interviewing, who I chose to interview with last because she\u2019s rooting for Olive (ph), and so I wanted her to see the other candidates and see how <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">But I think that Arvilla spoon-fed her questions and answers. I think she said I\u2019m going ask you this question; this is how you should answer because I kept seeing her look at Arvilla after she would answer questions and still her interview wasn\u2019t that great and her English is just and on top of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">kind of poor English, she had a lisp, which I don\u2019t care if people have but couple that with not great English and you\u2019re answering the phone all day long. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: I see, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: So, anyway, the first girl we interviewed they\u2019re going to do a second interview for and then if they like her we can just hire her because I told them, I said I would just hire her. The other candidates are over qualified but still would be good candidates. And so if they still want to see <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">more after they do the second interview with her, they\u2019ll call one of the other folks but if not we can just hire her and make her an offer, which I\u2019m happy about. She would be a great fit; I think that she\u2019s somebody that would want to apply for my position when I leave and would be good at it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">So there\u2019s that. And then yesterday I had a really difficult morning as well. I was just feeling really sad, it was really cold, [inaudible at 00:07:20], the stupid bed is huge so there\u2019s so much more cold than warm because I\u2019m only so big. And I had a difficult morning and Lucas randomly texted me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">saying hey, have a good day. And I said don\u2019t talk to me for a while, like you\u2019re an asshole, you woke up with somebody snuggly and I\u2019m all alone crying; I hate you. And then, I mean he was very understanding, and I apologized later. I said I\u2019m sorry, I just and I\u2019m also frustrated with myself again <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">because it\u2019s just this repetitiveness. I\u2019m sick of feeling this way; I\u2019m sick of talking about the same shit, I\u2019m sick of feeling sad about the same shit. And I said you know other people have real problems, and he kind of said yes, but it\u2019s all relative. I mean security and happiness are also real <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">issues so that\u2019s okay that you want that. It was really nice of him; he\u2019s very understanding so that was good. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562130\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">I went on a date last night wait, I was going to say something else. Oh, Stephanie (ph) (ph) confronted me because she feels that I\u2019ve been making comments about, like jealous or snarky comments about how she ended up being in love with Aiden. And but we talked it over and but I guess that\u2019s why she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">kind of been ignoring me or avoiding me, which I did feel but was kind of unsure of what was going on. So then she told me and I told her and I said Stephanie (ph) (ph) don\u2019t ignore me. Don\u2019t just tell me; tell me. And I apologized to her sincerely. I said I\u2019m sorry, I feel and I explained I felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">confused after all these months of you saying you wanted to break it off with him all the sudden you\u2019re gung-ho in love. And it confused me and made me feel jealous and sad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">And she said obviously I forgave you already when it happened it\u2019s just I kind of pissed or upset, whatever. She said it\u2019s not fair, you know? And it\u2019s not. She\u2019s right. She said I don\u2019t want to feel like you want me to also be sad and lonely just because you are. And I said understandable even though I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">Anyway I had this date last night with the Match.com guy. And it went pretty well I think. I mean it was good conversation. The thing about these dates that I\u2019m going on or whatever is I\u2019m kind of gauging it like if we had a nice enough time and there weren\u2019t too many awkward silences, then I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">yes, why not try it again. But I think I\u2019m having a hard time knowing what to concentrate on because then I get worried. Wait what if I waste all this time going on dates with this person and then we find out some big thing that we haven\u2019t gone over that\u2019s a huge clash or whatever? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">I think it\u2019s all just kind of goes back to my feelings of why even try, the shit\u2019s going to fail like usually anyway. Or just not really having a concept of forever and thinking about because my parents were divorced; everybody gets divorced; everybody breaks up. I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: Why [inaudible at 00:10:51] start?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Yes. Or why am I going to be always if I\u2019m dating somebody and things are going well am I always going to be looking for just in case there\u2019s a better person because I made this mistake before with Franklin (ph), or am I going to be always wondering what\u2019s going to come up that\u2019s going make <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">us break up then I\u2019m going to be my own downfall? I\u2019m just, I\u2019m feeling really unsure about how I don\u2019t know how to date. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to be concentrating on and I think it\u2019s because I\u2019ve never have done this kind of contrived dating. It\u2019s always just been like I\u2019ve met somebody <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">and got to know them more organically or knew them through friends. And this is so starting from nothing. I don\u2019t know anything about these people even from their, I mean from their Match.com profile <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562130\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:11:43] you get so sure you\u2019re going to be disappointed and it\u2019s going to blow up and you\u2019re going to be really upset about it? You feel like, I guess to see another aspect of it that you are sure you are going to feel you should have known better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: Right, or I should have asked more questions in the very, very beginning about stuff. Like question hairstyle or something like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Something else that crossed my mind is the best date you\u2019ve described so far is the first person you interviewed this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right. Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: And I think it\u2019s because she\u2019s kind of on top of her shit and conveys I think conveys something about I don\u2019t know being self-reliant or being able to look out for herself or sort of do what she needed for herself even if you guys weren\u2019t giving her enough to do or she\u2019s getting bored or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: Right. I mean I don\u2019t know we had some stuff in common I guess, me and this guy, and we had made conversation. But what if I don\u2019t know. Now I can\u2019t, yesterday I had all these big things on my mind like what if this, what if that, what if I find out this, what if we realize this? But now I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">can\u2019t think of them anymore. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">I\u2019m just kind of unsure of how to think about a possible next relationship. I think what I said to my mother, I went to Chicago this, oh yes on a visit, and on the way home I said to my mom that I was feeling like I could never really envision myself being in a relationship and being in love or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">having somebody love me or whatever. And that is weird because I love people and I\u2019ve been in love and I know how to love and I love lots of my friends and family and I know they love me and lots of love. But for some reason now, after Franklin (ph) and after this year of dealing with this break up <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200452\">and all this Lucas stuff and whatever, I\u2019m now starting to have difficulty envisioning myself in a functioning and happy relationship. And my mom said I understand that but if it makes you feel any better I can. I can totally see you in a nice relationship and whatever and maybe it won\u2019t last forever <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200453\">but if it does great and you\u2019ll see what happens. We all know, whatever, life happens. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">But I\u2019m having a harder time seeing it. I just didn\u2019t having a hard time seeing myself be as comfortable with somebody as I was with Franklin (ph) I guess in terms of my issues, my quirks, the way that I like to keep my house. Even though we had lots of fights about all that stuff and he wasn\u2019t always <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">accepting of all that stuff and wanted me to change things that I think were unfair to ask me to change or pressure me to change or make me seem like I need to change as an ultimatum kind of thing. But overall we felt very comfortable together and I\u2019m just having a hard time envisioning myself feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200472\">that way with anybody else now. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562130\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">And I feel like that\u2019s going to get in the way of people that maybe that could happen with because I\u2019m just so man it\u2019s going to fail. [Pause] I was e-mailing with Stephanie (ph) yesterday, I was having this very upset day and we were talking a lot about how she\u2019s being very understanding and very caring <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200491\">and that\u2019s very nice. And she said basically so you hate your job, you don\u2019t really have a social life, you\u2019re not really enjoying the whole process of having to make dates and meet lots of people and whatever, which I\u2019m not because it\u2019s just really time-consuming. And then I schedule dates and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200492\">I realize oh, it\u2019s too much stuff in one week and then I\u2019ll have to cancel and I seem like a flake and it\u2019s just <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">Whatever, anyway, and she said you don\u2019t like your living situation because you have a lump on the couch every day when you come home and it\u2019s hard. She said so basically of course you\u2019re, regardless of Celexa, still unhappy. I wish so badly I had a solution for you and I wish things, something could <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B1\">change that but it\u2019s true. She\u2019s right, I\u2019m unhappy with my job, she said you basically are unhappy with every aspect of your life, which is true and the Celexa is really helping and I\u2019m really happy that I made that decision and don\u2019t want to go back on I\u2019m staying on the 10 milligrams, which seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B2\">fine. I mean I\u2019m not seeing huge side effects but I\u2019m still seeing differences in my attitude and stuff and my mom says she does too and Stephanie (ph) also. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">But other than that and the routines that I\u2019m creating in terms of waking up early and working out and working out a little when I get home and sticking to that, are kind of the only things that are holding me together it feels like. I am horribly sick of living with Helen (ph) (ph). I just [pause] <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">she\u2019s just always on the couch, she still doesn\u2019t have a job yet, she hasn\u2019t I mean why doesn\u2019t she go back and bag groceries or something? I don\u2019t know go do something in the interim. Don\u2019t lay around all day. I\u2019m depressed and I\u2019m lonely and do I have to come home to a house where my roommate\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D2\">laying on the couch? I don\u2019t know, just it\u2019s depressing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">Apparently she\u2019s lost 22 pounds in the last few months because she\u2019s been trying to diet, which is great for her but she\u2019s also really fat so 22 pounds is 3 pounds for me. And, but regardless, she doesn\u2019t cook, I don\u2019t have somebody that I can cook with. I would like to live with this is what it is. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">And Stephanie (ph) said, she said no I don\u2019t think this is unreasonable for you to want this. And I would like somebody that I live with that kind of has the similar level of activity as me. Even laying on the couch for every minute of her free time, maybe wants to work out with me, cook dinner together. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F2\">I can never cook dinner really for myself because I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t like cooking that kind of stuff because then I have leftovers and I don\u2019t eat I\u2019m sick of eating it whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">She always orders food, she\u2019s a mess, she\u2019s messy, she\u2019s not considerate. I left a mug I washed some dishes before I left and she had a bowl or two in there and of course I just washed them; they\u2019re in the sink whatever. I had a mug, a mug, that I\u2019d already rinsed out that was still in the fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">sink when I got home. And I\u2019m thinking either you\u2019re weird and didn\u2019t use any dishes that you had to wash yourself and B, you\u2019re inconsiderate. You should have been like oh let me wash this mug. And I left by accident pots and pans that I was about to put away. I left them on them on the stovetop or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200512\">whatever just because I forgot to put them in the place where we keep them. And they\u2019re still there. You know that\u2019s not where the fucking pots and pans go, you understand that I washed them, put them in the drainer, took them out of the drainer, put them on the oven and forgot to put them away. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200513\">couldn\u2019t have just fucking put them away? I hate living with this person. And it\u2019s a big problem. And so I, what do I concentrate on trying to change because these three  things, social life, home life, work life, suck. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562130\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">THERAPIST: Well I think I know what you\u2019re saying is entirely true about your roommate and of course it\u2019s reasonable that you\u2019d want somebody who kind of had her shit together more to be living with, especially given how you\u2019re feeling it would make a big difference. But I think you\u2019re also commenting <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200531\">on something with me. Where I know at one level obviously you know how this works. But on another level I think you feel like I\u2019m sitting here like a lump and I see all these things out of place in your life and all this stuff you\u2019ve got to take care of. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">And I could be encouraging and I could be telling you what to do and how to handle it and I could be saying oh good job here, and let\u2019s throw that in here, and here\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do here, and good for you on this, and you really should do that, sort of cleaning up, helping you clean up the mess. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200551\">And being much more active and showing that I can do these sort of active, constructive things that I\u2019m supposed to be doing that will also help you feel better. And I don\u2019t do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">And I think I probably feel to you sort of really quite passive a lot of the time or not engaged in the way that you want. And I think you not entirely sure what you feel is all. I think sort of it sort of taps right into this feeling of being disappointed and wanting me to be there for you in a different <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200571\">way that is more energizing for you and kind of activating and reassuring. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">And there\u2019s something else too. It also starts to reflect, I think, I\u2019m trying to say that it\u2019s something like I think you see your roommate as in some ways being like your mom and your brother, kind of not like an addict [inaudible at 00:23:27] of anything, but sort of passive, not able to do for herself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200591\">And I\u2019m not saying your mom is always like this but I think there\u2019s a side of her like sometimes she can be like that and it drives you nuts. And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that you fear you have that in you or you don\u2019t want to think about yourself as being that way in some kind <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">CLIENT: No, I know I have it in me. I mean I spent a lot of time since the last year coming home and smoking as much pot as I could as soon as possible and laying on my bed or couch for hours. I mean when I was in Waltham still I would, I mean I was in my room for most of the day. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562130\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Oh, I mean I don\u2019t think you ever mentioned that to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F\">CLIENT: Well because I hated, I really -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20063\">CLIENT: No, I know, I know, I know. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">THERAPIST: It sounds like me to come downing [inaudible at 00:24:15]. Do you think it\u2019s clearly something that you are really upset about having done and feel really ashamed about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">CLIENT: Yes, I feel ashamed, yes. And I even felt ashamed the other day when I got home and Helen (ph) said hey want to watch an episode of Revenge? And it was almost like she had been lonely all day waiting for me to come home and watch TV with her. And then I felt peer-pressure and this peer-pressure <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200671\">thing is something that I kind of mentioned I think before [inaudible at 00:24:47] [phone ringing] sorry. Sorry. But I felt peer pressure to do so. And so where I was going to do a little workout, I ended up laying on the couch for two hours. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">And I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t even want that to be a thing. I don\u2019t want to get back into that. I like, like I told you, this routine of trying to work out more is really what\u2019s kind of keeping things together more for me because it\u2019s taking up some time in the morning and energizing me for the day and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200691\">in the evening it\u2019s helping me so that I\u2019m not just coming home like oh I hate my job like I hate my life. I say okay I\u2019m going to work out for an hour and now it\u2019s already 7:30, great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Right. It sounds like you feel as though you\u2019re sort of almost like staying 10 yards ahead of this sort of lump monster and running hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: Right. And depression and I think Celexa really hasn\u2019t been what\u2019s helped me and so yes, you\u2019re right; I am. And so to have a job that I want to not do because I\u2019m just resentful about everything and then a roommate that\u2019s is unpolite and Stephanie (ph) is trying to convince me to tolerate her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And also a new report who you, it seems like it plays with the energies as well in a way that the candidate you like is saying I\u2019m not a lump, I would do this, I would do that, even if there\u2019s nothing to do she will find something to do that was effective. Whereas the other one, you anticipate <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F1\">will need a lot of your help, won\u2019t really be good at stuff, is sort of getting isn\u2019t achieving in the interview and getting interview questions right. Yes, I see. So they\u2019re all kind of organized. And I do think that starts to emerge in here when you feel like I don\u2019t have much to say or <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">CLIENT: You aren\u2019t saying oh why don\u2019t you do this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">THERAPIST: Right. Right, yes. You need to get out and okay let me see your workout routines and I want to see -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">CLIENT: Right -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">THERAPIST: How many of those dishes did you put away and how many are left in yes, something like that. Sort of like the lump monster is in the room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">CLIENT: Right, and right. And Stephanie (ph) feels that I should be applying outside of MIT in terms of the job scene, which is hard for me because the benefits it\u2019s hard to get into MIT so why leave? I mean if I can get back in but why and then not to mention the extension school stuff, which I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200791\">signed up for a class. Did I tell you that? That I signed up for another class already? I don\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">THERAPIST: No, I was smiling and distracted because I\u2019m saying okay where\u2019s my scorecard while I\u2019m keeping track of all the things you\u2019re doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562130\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">CLIENT: Right, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes, but no I don\u2019t think you told me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">CLIENT: Well I\u2019m really actually excited about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">CLIENT: It\u2019s because I haven\u2019t for a while since I struggled (ph). And I\u2019m still really not sure what I\u2019m doing with that degree but I figured I\u2019ll take a class and see how I get back into it. And I found this class and it\u2019s a psychology class. It\u2019s an online class, which is great for me because with <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200851\">work and everything it\u2019s really nice to not have to worry about going to an actual class. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">But it\u2019s less of a psychology, like cognitive or I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll have to read the description again. But it describes kind of how studying adult development can that adult development can and should be studied in the same way as child development. And it, the class is focusing on stress and adult <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200871\">things, adult stressors in adult lives, particularly timing in terms of women over the age of 30 and preference of timing and whatever. And also the class will allow us to look at our own daily lives and stresses and anxieties and help us learn how to deal with them better. I said whoa this class is <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200872\">hand-made for me to be the first class I\u2019m taking after two or three semesters of no classes. So I\u2019m really excited about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">But anyway so that\u2019s another reason, because do I want to sacrifice getting that really inexpensive MIT Master\u2019s degree from an expensive school and so there was that. And then she also, Stephanie (ph) also thinks that in addition to applying elsewhere, just because I should, that I need to talk to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200891\">Helen (ph) or should talk to Helen (ph) basically about how I feel like she misrepresented the way that she was going to be a roommate which I do because she kind of implied that she might be clean or neat or not a lazy fuck. And that I should talk to her and talk to her about how I\u2019m not happy and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200892\">that this isn\u2019t working and I\u2019ve had to talk to her about things that bother me but I\u2019m just not happy living with her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">And I said yes, I agree and maybe that would be helpful but it\u2019s just another one of those situations where I\u2019m again the bad guy. I\u2019m always the one having to talk to people about stuff, I was the one that had to break up with Franklin (ph), I was the one, I mean it\u2019s just like and I was the bad guy <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B1\">to him, I was the asshole who didn\u2019t want to make it work anymore. And so this is a similar situation where I\u2019m the asshole who instead of trying to make it work with Helen (ph) is telling her can you move out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">And I mean if she doesn\u2019t get a job, which unfortunately, well not unfortunately fortunately for her; unfortunately for me because I can get her kicked out if she didn\u2019t get a job and wasn\u2019t going to pay her bills. I don\u2019t know. Stephanie (ph) said you should talk to her and say with the whole job <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D1\">thing maybe it\u2019s better that you move back in with your parents for a while and get on your feet. But this is not a conversation that I feel willing to have. It\u2019s always I\u2019m always dealing with shit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:31:05] stuff going on there where I mean it\u2019s really quite funny that you wind up feeling like the asshole with Franklin (ph) and with your roommate. And the reason you broke up with Franklin (ph) was I guess largely -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562130\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20091\">CLIENT: He was an asshole.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yes. That he was doing things that were clearly out of the bounds of what you both really would think was okay. And there was some other stuff about how he talks to you and things like that. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20095\">CLIENT: Yes, it was largely him and not me so, but then I felt like the asshole.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20097\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s the part that strikes me. And again with your roommate, I mean I don\u2019t remember well how she represented herself but if you\u2019re saying a lot of it is that she sort of said up front she was not like this and then is like this or has become like this I wonder how you then become the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200971\">asshole there, you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20099\">CLIENT: Because instead of just talking to her like an adult and saying Helen (ph) can you change your entire way of living and personality, I\u2019m instead saying I don\u2019t want to live with you. And it\u2019s like oh what did I do? I tried to take out the trash and give you the remote, you know? That\u2019s what <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200991\">I would feel like she would be thinking because she had been trying with that to be honest but I mean it still doesn\u2019t change the fact that I don\u2019t like living with somebody that is like her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009B\">She doesn\u2019t none of her clothes are even hanging in her closet. They\u2019re just on the floor in a pile. And then she leaves her door open and I have to close it because I don\u2019t want my cat to look in there. I don\u2019t know what the hell she has in there on the floor that they\u2019ll eat or get into, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009B1\">know. [Pause] I just I <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D\">THERAPIST: There seems like there\u2019s something going on where you feel incredibly guilty holding people responsible. And I think it\u2019s probably true as much as you can rail about him like with your brother for example, maybe with your mom but certainly with Franklin (ph) and with your roommate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yes, my that\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A1\">THERAPIST: In other words you have this vision of this sort of panicked version of them saying hey I\u2019m trying, I\u2019m doing my best, this is all I can do and you\u2019re being an asshole and giving me a hard time. I guess it seems to me to reflect your feeling a lot of guilt about having expectations for them <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A11\">of I don\u2019t have anything at all, I don\u2019t have anything at all but she got the trash; big deal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A3\">CLIENT: Right, offer me her big fucking deal and again those items are just kind of what I was able to tell her that would just kind of make things a little bit more tolerable, a little bit more tolerable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yes because I keep in my mind going back to my impression. I mean I don\u2019t know if I really knew the details that, about how she would be as a roommate but my impression is you had this sense or she said she wasn\u2019t going to be like this, like the, she\u2019d be more active and doing stuff. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A51\">know, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A7\">CLIENT: Or maybe she didn\u2019t but I just didn\u2019t anticipate that somebody could lay on the couch for four hours straight every single day of their life or more. I didn\u2019t anticipate that I think is what it was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s strange (ph) because you\u2019ve seen that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AB\">CLIENT: Right. I guess, yes. Also to be fair to myself, I wasn\u2019t aware that she had Fibromyalgia and bipolar disorder when I agreed to move in with her. And those have big [inaudible at 00:35:36] impact on her behavior I think which is okay for her but it\u2019s something I have to want to live with her <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200AB1\">and those diseases.

It\u2019s the same for my roommate. I want a roommate who is perceptive and notices oh those dishes don\u2019t belong there; let me put them where they go. Or <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200AD1\">hey look the shower door is off the track instead of just shoving it back why don\u2019t I see if I can fix it because every time I get in the shower I\u2019m fixing the fucking door. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Right, but there\u2019s a sort of split where you say that and are clearly frustrated about it but feel really guilty apparently -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B1\">CLIENT: Because I feel like it\u2019s something that I can\u2019t tell somebody. You can tell somebody to take out the trash and ask them to please be more considerate with the remote control in the living room. You can\u2019t tell somebody hey can you be perceptive, can you be a perceptive human.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Sure you can. You can say there\u2019s all this stuff that has to be done around the apartment that somehow I notice that you never do. I mean that\u2019s like the same <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B5\">CLIENT: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. See, I don\u2019t think though. I think that that\u2019s such a big deal to have how can I tell somebody -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I guess it\u2019s striking because I mean -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B9\">CLIENT: Because I feel like she\u2019s also, and then I also feel like the bad guy -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Right. I think that\u2019s why you don\u2019t think it because basically that is what you\u2019re saying to me. You might have said something like there\u2019s al these things she doesn\u2019t notice around the apartment and I\u2019m saying well you can tell her there\u2019s all these things she doesn\u2019t notice around the apartment. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BB1\">I don\u2019t -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD\">CLIENT: But then I\u2019m a jerk because in my mind I see her saying things like oh but I just don\u2019t notice them so what am I supposed to do. Why are you being such a jerk? I didn\u2019t notice. One day the milk was on the counter the whole day because I left it out. Fine, but if you\u2019re home all day milk obviously <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD1\">goes in the fridge. But yes, I think that you\u2019re right, I could say to her -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BF\">THERAPIST: See this is the split that I have in mind where on one hand you say that and you\u2019re exasperated. But on the other hand you say well if I told her then she would say well like I said I was distracted and you left it out anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C1\">CLIENT: Right, exactly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C3\">THERAPIST: So, which is you feel these very different ways about it that have no contact with each other. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C7\">THERAPIST: You feel sort of sheepish and guilty and you\u2019re an asshole on one side and furious and righteous on the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes, so I\u2019m, I don\u2019t know. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CB\">THERAPIST: And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CD\">CLIENT: Right, righteous because I almost feel like why should I have to tell you that there\u2019s no need for 10 empty ice trays in the freezer? Why is that something that needs to be taught? But at the same time I don\u2019t want to say that to her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Right and when you think about saying it to her, you almost feel like you have no right to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D1\">CLIENT: Exactly. Well if I\u2019m not filling up the ice trays or taking out the empty ones but then I feel that if I did that I would just be cleaning up after her mess and she will never learn. But it\u2019s not my job to teach her any other way so yes you\u2019re right, there\u2019s a huge split.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562130\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D3\">THERAPIST: I think so, yes. [Pause] It reminds me a bit of playing [pretty women] (ph) with your mom and brother and your roommate interestingly. The split between sort of really holding somebody responsible and, that\u2019s not quite the way I want to put it, but anyway I mean sort of appreciating their <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200D31\">diagnosis, you know what I mean? Like, the sort of split that can come from dealing with somebody with an addiction or something that really affects their functioning where on one hand you treat them like just another person responsible as anybody would be and on the other hand you kind of have to give <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200D32\">them more room because they have this diagnosis. And those things are kind of separate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D5\">CLIENT: Right, but I have a hard time separating them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D7\">THERAPIST: You have a hard time putting them together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D9\">CLIENT: Oh really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yes. You separate them. That\u2019s what you do when you separate them. In other words -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200DD\">CLIENT: Oh like they\u2019re sick but they\u2019re still a regular person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yes, right. You respond as if they\u2019re a regular person and get pissed off and feel every right to be and then you sort of image them as being sick and feel like well she\u2019s sick, she really just can\u2019t do it and I\u2019m just being an asshole; I\u2019m kicking her when she\u2019s down and out (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E1\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E3\">THERAPIST: [Pause] And, [pause] yes, and there\u2019s kind of <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E5\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E7\">I don\u2019t know. I guess I wonder if it comes, if it\u2019s a way of warding off a feeling of helplessness or it comes from anticipating being helpless against actually getting them to do something. Like you\u2019re really pissed off or you\u2019re really guilty of I don\u2019t know, you don\u2019t really anticipate that people <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200E71\">actually work with them. I\u2019m not sure but there\u2019s more to it. We should stop for now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E9\">CLIENT: Okay, so I\u2019ll see you on Monday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Right and not Friday and the following Monday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200ED\">CLIENT: And not Friday and the following Monday. All right, thanks much. [inaudible at 00:43:45].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200EF\">THERAPIST: No problem. Thanks, you too.
