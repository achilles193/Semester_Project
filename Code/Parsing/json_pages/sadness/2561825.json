I\u2019m feeling pretty overwhelmed this week. Last week I was feeling numb. That lasted another, like, day. Switched to being overwhelmed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s see if we can sort of relieve you of some of that today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Well, I have a question. So people keep asking Josh if he\u2019s anxious and trying to give him anxiety drugs and trying to ask if he wants to talk to a therapist and all that sort of thing. And they said especially when he leaves, they would recommend it to help him process what\u2019s going on. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">I feel like that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing here, right, is processing this, which is different than, like, trying to sleep or not exhaust myself with anxiety or stuff like that. I\u2019m not sure exactly what the means. Like, she said that, and I was like, well, it makes sense. But then I wasn\u2019t even sure what that meant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Well, I think it\u2019s a way of processing can happen on several different levels. So I think psychologists love to use that word, and I think it means different things for different people. I think there\u2019s a way of kind of almost unpacking everything that\u2019s happening to you emotionally. If <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">you think when you\u2019re dealing with a crisis, with you\u2019ve sort of been in a prolonged crisis, you know, since he was hospitalized for this last round. It\u2019s like things keep happening, you know. A doctor comes in and gives you one story. Another doctor sees you in the next day, and it\u2019s another plan. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">And it\u2019s like you guys keep having to gear up for, like, \u201cOK, this is what we\u2019re doing now. Like, we\u2019re getting a pump. What kind? What does this mean? Are you on the donor list? Or, you know, heart transplant list or not?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">In the moment, you just kind of absorb the information and make whatever decisions you can, and then move on to the next thing. And it\u2019s like this stuff just keeps going. And so I think one level of processing is just kind of taking some time to actually sit and kind of unpack it, to talk about each <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">thing, and just almost kind of lay it out in front of you, rather than having to keep absorbing everything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Because otherwise, what would happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I think what happens otherwise is sort of what happened to you last week. There\u2019s so much that you can\u2019t possibly think about it, so you get numb. And then at some point, like, the dam breaks. (Laughter) And the numbness goes away, and you feel completely overwhelmed. And that might feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">sad. It might feel scared. It might feel, who knows, a combination of those things. But there\u2019s only so much that we can kind of tolerate before we have to kind of figure out what we actually feel about it, what do we think about what\u2019s going on, and sort of deciding how to respond to it, rather than <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">just marching ahead and plowing through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">So I think one thing is just being able to talk about it and figure out what are you feeling. And then the next piece of processing I think is sort of making meaning of what\u2019s happening. Like, how do you come to understand some of those, like, big existential questions of and you might never have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">kind of a real answer. Like, why do things happen? I don\u2019t think we ever really know why. But to make meaning in your own life of, well, this happened, and now what does that mean for you? How do you make that part of your story? And I think part of how you\u2019ve done that is kind of figuring you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">continually asking yourself that question of, you know, do I want to stay in this relationship? Is this a forever relationship for me? And you kind of kept asking yourself that question and answering it again for yourself. I think that\u2019s part of your processing. It\u2019s part of how you make meaning of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">what does it mean that you\u2019re with this person. And part of your story with him is managing his illness and managing kind of the crises that crop up because of it. Does that answer your question? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561825\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess my first thought was we keep trying to, like well, we have to explain this to people, making it kind of into a story that makes sense. And then eventually, we maybe believe the story, like the whole pacemaker story, and then we would tell people, \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably going to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">this (inaudible 04:20) it\u2019s going to be great.\u201d And then that just ends in, like, massive disappointment. (Chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and then you have to make another story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: And then you have to make another story, and that\u2019s exhausting. I don\u2019t want to do that. I don\u2019t want to just make it all fit into a story, because it\u2019s not going to ever, I don\u2019t think, work out. (inaudible 04:40)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Well, I don\u2019t think you can necessarily write a story into the future. I think your job of processing is coming up with the story for how it fits in up until now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: It\u2019s almost too soon though because that could change tomorrow and the next day, and that\u2019s exhausting to (sighs) revise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Right. Well, maybe that\u2019s the difference between sort of being in a crisis mode, where things change every day versus finding a place of stability. And stability, when it comes to this part of your life, might be fairly short-lived. What\u2019s stable now might be different than what\u2019s stable <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">in three days or tomorrow. Other parts of your life are not like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: So we write a journal for him every day on he has a website (chuckles) that the hospital they have a service that they provide. It\u2019s a place where you can just put updates for people. And Josh writes them and he writes like, \u201cI\u2019m in a ton of pain. This is the most miserable thing that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">ever happened. I know that I\u2019m getting better, so that\u2019s great. Thanks everyone, but today was terrible.\u201d (Laughter) And then I tend to write, like, happier things. And it\u2019s just really disconcerting sometimes to, like I\u2019m sure for people too, it\u2019s really disconcerting to, like, go back and forth <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">(laughter) between our two journal entries. But we\u2019re also, like even he will, like, try to write to, like, make sense of it just on a daily basis. For other people too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Right, for other and also, I think, for yourselves. I mean, I think that\u2019s part of what processing really is, is, like, how do you make sense of this, you know, crazy, unexpected thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: And last week was really, really difficult because he wasn\u2019t he was exhausted. He was coming off medications. They were trying to put him on other medications. And he was, like, basically crying all day, every day. Like, just a disaster. Really needy. Like, I was excited after I think I last <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">talked to you to, like, get some sort of like, I feel like I was going to (inaudible 06:48) but it all, like, fell apart. Like, he was just a mess. (Laughter) And I felt really conflicted about this. I talked him into he\u2019s, like, trying not to take extra drugs. Just trying to, like, tough through <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">things. And I pushed him into taking more drugs, which turned out to be a good idea, but that was sort of difficult. He sometimes gets so tired or whatever it is. Hungry, exhausted, whatever. He can\u2019t make a rational decision. So I had to, like, \u201cI think that you probably should just try this, try that.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F3\">And it worked out. But it was quite a crisis.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561825\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s a hard position for you to be in too, to have to push him to make decisions that\u2019s he\u2019s uncomfortable with, that from somebody\u2019s who\u2019s watching it, you can see that it\u2019s what he needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, it was mostly that I really had to be there, because he was just falling apart, which was really difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: I mean, even how he can be in the hospital surrounded by a million doctors. It\u2019s, like, not enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Not enough to make him feel secure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Well, even yesterday. He\u2019s been having this incredible, incredible pain. Like, to the point of, like, having mental breakdowns, he\u2019s in so much pain. And people keep asking him, \u201cAre you just anxious? Are you just afraid of pain, and then you have pain?\u201d And he got into a screaming match with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">a nurse about it. A nurse practitioner, actually, who does the pump, because she was trying to tell him to trust her, and she was going to make this change, and it would eventually resolve. And she wasn\u2019t listening to him. And he started swearing at her. And she told him that they couldn\u2019t work like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B2\">this together. They were a team, and (sighs) we ended up getting a social worker involved, because it\u2019s really hard for them to come in and, like, not listen and just try to change up drugs and you\u2019re in an incredible amount of pain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: It must feel really horrible to feel like you\u2019re not being believed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Well, this continues (ph). I mean, he had a pain management team come talk to him yesterday that was like, \u201cWe don\u2019t really understand this. This is really different and unusual. (Laughter) Are you sure you\u2019re not anxious? Are you sure this is -\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cMy only anxiety comes from having <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">this incredible pain.\u201d We got one we got the physical therapist said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ve had other patients like you. They\u2019re not nuts.\u201d And she talked to the pain people. But, like, there\u2019s no one else doing this but me. And he\u2019s trying, but sometimes he\u2019s not in his right mind. Sometimes he\u2019s swearing at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">the nurses. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Which probably doesn\u2019t get him a great result.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: It was really scary, actually, because she\u2019s going to be, like, in charge of him until he has a heart transplant post (ph) to the hospital. We (ph) can\u2019t alienate her. (Chuckles) Yeah, so this all has been very overwhelming. Because, like, yeah, there\u2019s no one sticking up for him, except him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Is there a patient advocate? Or is that the social worker\u2019s position?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Well, the social worker is there, but somebody still needs to be there. Like, he still is having a hard time being like, \u201cOK, I\u2019m just going to page this person, page this person.\u201d Also, because he\u2019s getting a lot of this, like, pushback. Like, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t just want some Ativan?\u201d Like, (laughter).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561825\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: And why does he not want the Ativan?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Because he feels like people are not listening to him, that he\u2019s anxious because he has incredible amounts of pain. So why can\u2019t they fix the pain and talk to him about the pain?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Why can\u2019t they fix both?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: They can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: Does he have to feel I guess maybe the question for you to ask him when he\u2019s in a calmer place is that getting some relief from some of the anxiety even though the anxiety might be coming from the pain, getting some relief from the anxiety doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019d have to give up on (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">10:51) pain too. It doesn\u2019t have to be either\/or.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think he wants to do one thing at a time, which I understand it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making the right choice by saying, \u201cLet\u2019s table the Ativan discussion.\u201d And he\u2019s really scared about (inaudible 11:08). I mean, like I was when I was first started taking stuff (inaudible 11:11). He <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">said he lost touch with reality last week, and it was really scary. They\u2019re still not sure exactly what drug -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: Caused that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: caused it, but, like, he didn\u2019t know what we were saying to him or what was going on, and he was really freaked out. And who knows?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: He doesn\u2019t want to lose that control. And if he\u2019s afraid that the Ativan might feel like it is giving up some control\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Well, they\u2019ve been giving him some at night, which I convinced him to do, plus some sleeping things, which I think is good. But I don\u2019t think -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, sleep is really important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, and that\u2019s been helping. I don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know. The drugs are such trial and error. He\u2019s on so many. I mean, every single one is a trial and error. (Chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and how they all interact with each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: It doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s some clear person in charge of that. Well (ph), the interactions. I mean, the pain management doctor let him choose yesterday. It was a discussion, which was good, but he had a choice. (Chuckles) It\u2019s really overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a lot to juggle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, and if I push him a little too much and he\u2019s in a lot of pain, he\u2019ll, like, lose it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Is he yelling at you too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Well, he yelled at me once, and I got really upset at him. (Chuckles) This is the same day of the nurse yelling at him. And he\u2019s been really, really trying hard not to, but I can tell it\u2019s a huge struggle. Which I really appreciate, and I tell him that, but I don\u2019t know what he should be allowed <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">to do or not. Should he be allowed to scream and yell? Probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Well, being able that sort of, in making your case for the therapist well, it\u2019s not OK to yell and scream at your therapist. It is OK to yell and scream in front of your therapist about all the things you want to yell and scream about. So that would be an appropriate place where he can <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">really express what he\u2019s feeling, you know. Express his anger and express his frustration and express how unfair all this is. And have somebody be able to kind of hold that in a way that a lot of the medical professionals that are dealing with him don\u2019t necessarily have the time to kind of sit and hold <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D2\">all that really strong and intense and completely appropriate emotion. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561825\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and the social worker is doing that right now, but on a very, like, informal from time-to-time basis. And she has a therapist who specializes in devices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: Like, so that\u2019s good. Of course my first thought when she said that is that this person is in Brookline, and I\u2019m going to have to drive him there, and it\u2019s going to be even more overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 14:06) Well, what about his mom? Can you share some of this with other people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, we\u2019re all being trained on the bed on Friday morning, and we\u2019ll set up some sort of a schedule, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: Because you really can\u2019t be a full-time nurse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: No, but he\u2019s going to have four of us who are trained. A visiting nurse. But I\u2019m still unsure. There\u2019s no way to avoid me taking more of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Right, yes. You\u2019re going to be the primary person, but you certainly can\u2019t be the only person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, there\u2019s others, for sure. But he\u2019s also, I guess, been really needy lately. Like (pause), \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me.\u201d (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: That must be hard to hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a lot of pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: It is. And he\u2019s understanding. Like, today I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to come until this evening.\u201d But (chuckles) last week, when he was a total mess, he was sitting, crying to the social worker. And I came in, and he, like, had this mental breakdown about wanting to come in the mornings, not at <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">night, because he\u2019s just so tired. He has, like, the smallest bit of energy in the mornings. (Pause) I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019m going with this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s OK. You don\u2019t have to (inaudible 15:30).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Just balancing kind of your need his intense need for you to be there to take care of all these things and to take care of him, with your need to have some time for yourself too and take care of yourself and have some normalcy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, it\u2019s mostly that I\u2019ve been barely going to school, and (inaudible 15:55) becoming, like, really not really problematic, but kind of problematic. (Sighs) I mean, he\u2019s been needy for other people too. Like, my parents were going to come help me with some stuff with the house the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">other day, and he begged them to come. And he\u2019s been asking his mom to do stuff. It\u2019s not just me, but still [a lot] (ph) me. (Chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: More you than you can really manage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if I can manage it. It\u2019s really there\u2019s a chance he\u2019s going to come home next week, the end of next week, and that\u2019s sort of making everything too a little more real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: You look really anxious about the idea of him being home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be like. And he just got the new he got the smaller device he can walk around with yesterday. And just walking around, it occasionally beeps. And, like, the device is terrifying. It doesn\u2019t seem very sturdy. (Chuckles) Like, it has a high chance of problems. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">They gave him backup hand pumps just in case. It comes with a 45-minute battery life. It\u2019s going to cause so much anxiety for both of us, just the way it is. Like, despite the fact that we have to go get it checked out this (ph) week.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561825\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">I\u2019m going to have to change his, like, really gory dressing every day. I almost, like, passed out yesterday, (chuckles) like, watching him do it. Because I have to learn how to do it. It\u2019s going to be a lot. And making sure that he, like, walks every day, so he gets stronger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Have they started planning for you mentioned the visiting nurse is getting trained on it. Have they started planning on, like, how often will she come and <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: Everyday. But still (chuckles), I mean, they give us, like, a test. We have to pass before they\u2019ll let us help him. (Chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Well, that will (laughter) give you some assurance that you\u2019ll be ready when he\u2019s ready. What will you need to feel ready to have him come home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Having a visiting nurse come by is helpful. (Pause) I don\u2019t know. (Pause) Yeah, I have no idea. I mean, it\u2019s nice to know that we\u2019ll be back there, because we have to be every week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you have some safety net. A lot more responsibility does fall to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I guess if I can figure out how to I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to, like, balance it all and make it all (pause) work out. A lot depends on him and how he is managing by next week. If he\u2019s in constant agony, that\u2019s going to be really difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it seems like that needs to be under control. And maybe something for you to advocate for is that the pain needs to be under control before he comes home. Because (ph) you can\u2019t be adjusting medications on the fly. (Chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: I have my fingers crossed. They gave him [I think] (ph) like a morphine skin patch yesterday (inaudible 19:45) I hope that helps. And, I mean, I can\u2019t imagine the amount of pain he\u2019s in, because he\u2019s got, like, four open stomach wounds that he says feel like knives stabbing him, which he\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A91\">have until I guess the heart transplant. (Chuckles) But, I mean, that makes him either lose his mind like, just kind of a complete mental breakdown or start screaming at somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s really irritable, I would imagine. Pain does that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Chuckles) And it\u2019s exhausting. And he knows he has to, like, walk and stuff to get better, which makes it real (pause) all of this is compounded by the fact that, like, a couple floors of (inaudible 20:32) got destroyed by a pipe bursting last week. (Chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Oh, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really damaging his life because the occupational therapist built him, like, a vest thing to hold these things in place, because the more they shake, the more they hurt. And their equipment got destroyed. (Chuckles) So that just makes everything worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s unbelievable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s really awful. They had to close a lot of, I think, cancer floors and operating rooms. I\u2019m sure a lot of other people had their lives (inaudible 21:08) affected. So that\u2019s just another small little tragedy that just makes everything -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: And there\u2019s just so much it feels so unfair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: even worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Out of your control<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Well, and it doesn\u2019t a lot of the doctors don\u2019t know that that\u2019s happening. They don\u2019t understand why. I mean, he\u2019s got a pretty ghetto, like, vesting that they, like, Velcroed together.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561825\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: As a replacement?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">CLIENT: As a temporary fix. And they\u2019re trying to make him (ph) move and it\u2019s not working. I guess it all goes back to there\u2019s nobody who knows everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s that there\u2019s not, like, he doesn\u2019t have really, like, a central person that knows all the pieces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">CLIENT: Right. (Pause) And even if he is able to do it, he\u2019s still the patient, which still I was really struggling with this last week, but the (inaudible 22:02) nurse was trying to tell him how we\u2019re a team, you know. She wants them to be, like, colleagues. But there\u2019s still this incredible, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C51\">discrepancy in power. (Chuckles) I don\u2019t know what it is. It\u2019s not a dictatorship, but it\u2019s not a teamwork thing either. Or it can be sometimes, and sometimes it\u2019s not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Feeling like he doesn\u2019t have enough say or control over what is happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">CLIENT: He almost needs, like, someone to, like, second him.

As much as we\u2019ve gotten my parents involved and his mom involved, like, they can\u2019t do (inaudible 22:50).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">THERAPIST: What is his resistance to the therapist?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">CLIENT: He doesn\u2019t have a resistance to the therapist. The therapist will be outpatient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">THERAPIST: OK, so it\u2019s just not starting until he gets out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, he could see somebody inside. I think it\u2019s just too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Too much, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: And he really likes the social worker, and she\u2019s already been with him for a month-and-a-half.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Is that how long it\u2019s been already?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">CLIENT: Well, I\u2019m not sure how long (inaudible 23:25) total yet (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 23:26)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: (inaudible 23:28) Yeah, bring him out into the real world. Crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it doesn\u2019t sound like you feel ready at all.

I mean, it sounds like he really needs a full-time nurse, and somehow that becomes you. But you have a full-time job. Being a grad student is a full-time job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: It can also not be, which is really awful. [That\u2019s how I knew] (ph) I wanted to quit and go to the nursing school last week. I got over that, but I still, like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: The gory dressing. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: No, all of this is making, like, the gory part so much less of a problem. I mean, it\u2019s pretty gory, but (pause) I mean, Josh won\u2019t even [look at me] (ph). (Chuckles) I don\u2019t know. I guess I realized it wouldn\u2019t be really what I want. [I do want to do] (ph) what I\u2019m doing I just don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">how I\u2019ll ever get back into it in a real way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Have you talked to your advisor about taking a medical leave for this semester? Can you do that? What would that mean? Does that feel like something you would be interested in trying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know now. I mean, it\u2019s approaching, like, the amount of time that the semester\u2019s going to start. Soon I\u2019ll have to be more involved. (Chuckles) I don\u2019t know. Like, I seem to not be able to find some middle ground from wanting to give up and feeling like I need to be there <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F11\">all the time. I can\u2019t seem to this is always a problem. (Chuckles) And I always feel like I just want to quit, because I can\u2019t do it the way I want to do it. I don\u2019t know how to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561825\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess I would separate quitting from taking a semester off. That\u2019s not quitting. It might be, you know, depending upon how the next week goes and what it\u2019s like when you have him home. You know, thinking about taking I mean, it\u2019s really like family leave. You have a really sick <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F31\">family member. And it wouldn\u2019t be giving up on grad school or quitting it would be determining whether or not you are able to do it for the semester.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ll have to look and see if that\u2019s a benefit or that policy applies or something. But when I think about that too, like, three months would be when (chuckles) we (ph) would start thinking that maybe a heart is coming. So this is could just drag on and on. There could be complications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Right, and you really don\u2019t know until (crosstalk 26:40).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">CLIENT: After a few months, like, complications become pretty likely. Like, he could end up with this thing for a year, in and out of the hospital. Like, it could go on and on and on, which is also a (inaudible 26:51) can\u2019t really plan for. (Chuckles) I don\u2019t want to plan for it when I think about it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F91\">(Pause) I want to be (inaudible 27:00) school. (inaudible 27:01) productive. But his, like, need and, like, what\u2019s going on feels just so overwhelming. There\u2019s almost no way right now. I hope that can change a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, it sounds like it\u2019s getting to be really difficult and remaining difficult to predict what\u2019s going to happen with him medically. I think the thing that you can get better at predicting is knowing what kind of supports you can get. Like, you don\u2019t know exactly what his need is <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB1\">going to be, but as, I think, you get more experienced with this, figuring out how to get disability to shoulder some of you know, the emotional support is something that\u2019s hard to replace you on. But things like, you know, you\u2019re going to get really good at navigating how to get him rides places. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB2\">And you\u2019re going to get good at navigating how to get the visiting nurse to come and do more. And figuring out what kind of supports you can acquire, I think that\u2019s the place where it can become more predictable, and you can learn, hopefully through experience, how much of his care and support you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB3\">hand over to other people, whether it be professionals or, you know, getting his mom involved or getting friends involved to come by and, you know, spend a half-hour. It sounds like they\u2019ve been good about that at the hospital, and that\u2019s something you\u2019re going to want to kind of put in place at home <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB4\">too, that people come by. Bring a meal. Read him, you know, read him an article.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, people have been good about coming to the hospital. And he\u2019s been good about asking. So if we can keep that up, it\u2019ll be good. I was really excited about, like, government, like, social security. There\u2019s the ride, which will drive him. All this stuff. It\u2019s incredible to me how it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD1\">supposed to help people in crisis, because it takes so long to get set up. I mean, it could take another six months for his disability to kick in. And then I\u2019m not sure if we have to wait that long to help him get rides places and things. Like, luckily, we have people around, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s lots <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD2\">and lots of people where this is just no good.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200FC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561825\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Or it\u2019s not serving (inaudible 29:26).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">CLIENT: It sounds like a great program, but if it takes this long to get into place like, there\u2019s a girl we met a couple days ago who had her transplant in November.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">THERAPIST: Oh, this is the couple that you met?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: No, this is another they were in their early 20s. And she had just got out of college and was working for a temp agency, so she had no benefits. (Chuckles) Did I tell you about this before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">THERAPIST: No. You told me that you were going to meet a couple -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah, yeah. This couple, yeah. And she was saying how she had only just started getting, or she was still not getting disability. And her problems were very sudden. So she got really sick, ended up in the hospital for four months, like, immediately. And then ended up with a heart transplant <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201091\">that was, like, really emergency fast. Well, not that four months in the hospital is fast, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Your whole life to turn around, [it feels] (ph) fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">CLIENT: Very sudden, yeah, thing. So I think she said she still hadn\u2019t quite gotten disability or these rides set up, and she had her boyfriend and I think one parent around (inaudible 30:31). I don\u2019t know how they were keeping it together. [I didn\u2019t] (ph) get a chance to talk to her that long. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D1\">because she\u2019s already through the transplant and still not even getting these services, she has to come to the hospital constantly. And didn\u2019t even get a chance to work or save up any money before any of this happened. Like, (pause) I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 30:56) to imagine being able to rely up on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">CLIENT: Well, I was really excited about the fact that we were going to have this sort of, like, safety net. But it isn\u2019t very helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re just not sure where (ph) it\u2019s actually going to appear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">CLIENT: Someday it could be helpful, but it\u2019s really not in a crisis. So, I was misinformed. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">THERAPIST: Well, and I think it\u2019s those kinds of places where kind of, like, being this squeaky wheel and continuing to press the social worker and, you know, the cardiologist. Referrals and contacts and things like that tend to speed along the process, right. So you can\u2019t kind of sit back and wait <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201171\">for the process to work the way it\u2019s supposed to work. (Crosstalk 31:50) And that takes a lot of energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">CLIENT: Luckily, his mom\u2019s (inaudible 31:52) (ph), which is great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So, I mean, that, you know, in my limited experience with, you know, having people set up on disability, it\u2019s, like, repeating the phone calls to say, like, \u201cWhere\u2019s my what process is my application in?\u201d And, \u201cWe were supposed to hear back a week ago about this thing.\u201d So his mom <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B1\">is, you know, kind of following up and keeping tabs on that stuff. It tends to (pause) grease the wheel for a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">CLIENT: So, she seems to know what she\u2019s doing.

(Laughter) And I had a few friends come to the hospital and visit him with me. And I have a few people I know who have been through that at any moment. My friends have been good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m glad to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20129\">CLIENT I don\u2019t know. This past week I\u2019ve kind of wanted to just be by myself. (Chuckles) I spent the whole weekend, in fact, with my parents and Josh\u2019s mom, because it was his mom\u2019s birthday. My parents helped me fix up my apartment a little bit, make sure there weren\u2019t exposed plugs and fixing stuff. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201291\">Then I just, for some reason, spent the entire day (inaudible 33:59) with them on Sunday, again. I don\u2019t know (inaudible 34:04). Because at least my friends will talk about things other than Josh. I can ask them how they\u2019re doing and they\u2019ll tell me about whatever is going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s nice to have that distraction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, and it feels a little more normal. My parents, can\u2019t get them to stop talking about Josh for two minutes.

What television shows people are watching and who won the Golden Globes. I think a little bit of that is a good relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I [spent a lot] (ph) over this past week, spending too much time with my parents and watching too much television.

I had a little cold this past weekend, which didn\u2019t help things either. But yeah. Josh\u2019s mom goes to our gym and has told everyone at our gym, which has made me not want to go to our gym. (Chuckles) It\u2019s turned it from, like, an anonymous place into another place where people -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">THERAPIST: Are asking about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">CLIENT: Are asking, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s too bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D\">CLIENT: But, I mean, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but you want a place to escape to, where you can just pretend that everything is normal for a little bit, or at least just go into your own bubble and, you know, listen to your music and go for a run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">CLIENT: (Laughter) Instead of going to the gym the other day I forget which day it was freezing and snowing a little.

I mean, I certainly don\u2019t want to pressure you that this is sort of like a, you know, on your list of to-dos. But I think having, you know, when you can, having some place that you can go, where you can be anonymous. It can just be about, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B1\">be about you for an hour or a half an hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I mean, I definitely I\u2019ve been exercising more than I\u2019ve been going to school, neither of which I was doing a ton of. Which I kind of hate because, I mean, that\u2019s still how I, like, stay calm. Especially now I\u2019m feeling really agitated. Like, school does not calm me down (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D1\">like exercise does, and that\u2019s always made me feel bad, that I put more time there, that I could have been putting towards school (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2014C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561825\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s some research to back you up that exercise is really good for, you know, treating depression, treating anxiety. There\u2019s not a whole lot of research that says graduate is really Good for treating anxiety. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20151\">CLIENT: Well, I have to either quit or get through it. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20153\">THERAPIST: But I don\u2019t think you need to feel guilty about not being able to devote a lot of time to it right now. It may be necessary to make some decisions about what you do with this semester, but you certainly don\u2019t need to feel guilty about whether you choose to whether it\u2019s possible to kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201531\">of coast by and not produce a whole lot of work. Whether you take a leave, officially, you know. There\u2019s no reason to feel guilty about any that. And you do have to figure out what\u2019s going to work. Using exercise, because it calms you down, and that\u2019s healthy. You need to keep yourself going. You need <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201532\">to find ways to take care of yourself, because there\u2019s a lot of pressure on you right now. And if that means that the free time you have from taking care of Josh goes toward, you know, taking a run or going to yoga or going to the gym, then that\u2019s what you need to do. You [need to] (ph) take care of <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201533\">yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20155\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s hard. Sometimes it\u2019s hard for people to understand (chuckles) that, and I don\u2019t know why exactly. Like, Josh has never understood that about me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20157\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s part of what you need to survive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20159\">CLIENT: Yeah, but that seems really crazy to a lot of people. (Laughter) I sometimes think it\u2019s crazy too. But (pause), like, yesterday, I was sitting at the hospital feeling really empty, and I ended up taking off my entire manicure. (Laughter) (inaudible 39:24) I\u2019d also forgotten to take my Zoloft. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201591\">I don\u2019t know if it does anything anymore, but I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t help for this situation, and I really should have been running, [then I would have] (ph) saved my manicure, and not sat there all day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015B\">THERAPIST: You probably would have felt better. The manicure can be replaced. But I think, yeah, I mean, the fidgety and the restlessness, that\u2019s a really good sign, right, those are red flags that you\u2019re anxious. (Crosstalk 39:53)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D\">CLIENT: I try really hard to not do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, it\u2019s your body talking to you, letting you know what\u2019s going on. And it\u2019s important to recognize that, yeah, that that\u2019s how the anxiety is coming out, you know. I\u2019m not concerned about the fact you picked off your manicure I\u2019m concerned about the fact that you feel that anxious <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F1\">and feel guilty about the things that you can do to help yourself and to let go of the judgment. If other people think it\u2019s crazy, that\u2019s OK. For me to sit here and think it\u2019s not crazy, but it\u2019s important for you to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20161\">CLIENT: I mean, I have a friend, the friend who I got the manicure with, pulls her hair out. And my mom\u2019s always really worried about her, because she doesn\u2019t understand why she would pull her out. I completely understand why she would pull her hair out.

To the point where I think she\u2019s got fake hair at the moment. (Laughter) And my dad, he\u2019s trying to get Josh and me to listen to his hypnotist tapes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20167\">THERAPIST: Are you interested?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20169\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve listened to them.

A magical stops and (ph) things? It\u2019s too I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re supposed to just <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201691\">stop these irrational thoughts with a magical stop sign, and tell yourself that they\u2019re not as bad as you think they are, and stuff like that, which is kind of the problem. (Laughter) (inaudible 41:54)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, your problems are pretty real right now. (Pause) Responding to Dad, so that he stops asking you to listen to them, just tell him you\u2019re listening, that you\u2019ve, you know it\u2019s a really great suggestion and you\u2019re grateful for it. That way, you don\u2019t have to use your energy to fight <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2016B1\">with him or explain why that\u2019s not appropriate for you right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016D\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019ve stopped doing it. I used to respond that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and it\u2019s just not worth your energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20171\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s still really hard that I can\u2019t have a conversation with him about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20173\">THERAPIST: It would be nice if you could have a conversation and he could hear you, and (pause) be willing to actually what you need, rather than continuing to push something that you\u2019ve told him doesn\u2019t really work for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20175\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m almost at a point where I want to, like, ask people, like, farther away to come. Like, I have an aunt in Washington who offered to come. She also happens to be a nurse practitioner. And I know if I said -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20177\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you don\u2019t even need to ask. It sounds like she offered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20179\">CLIENT: Well, if I said yes, can you please come in February, she would come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Take her up on her offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017D\">CLIENT: Josh has friends, if he said can you please come. Like, also another step of, like, asking for help, but it feels like, do we really need this? (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017F\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have to judge whether or not you really need it. It would be helpful. You don\u2019t have to be at that a bottom (ph), can\u2019t possibly do anymore by yourself in order to allow yourself to ask for or to accept the offers. You\u2019re not even asking you would be accepting offers of help, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2017F1\">it sounds like. People have offered to come, and you\u2019re allowed to accept it, because it would be helpful. You don\u2019t have to pass some bar of necessity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20181\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard. I guess people don\u2019t generally ask that of other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20183\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s a nice world (ph) when people do and you can count on each other for help. You don\u2019t have to be completely self-sufficient. It\u2019s OK to allow people to help and be a part of the team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20185\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s crazy I\u2019ve only had my parents involved for, I don\u2019t know, a few months? And I want, like, three times as many people as involved as they are. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20187\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s getting bigger. And, you know, I think the support you need is more because as you see the, you know, intensity continuing like this, you need more of a break and you need more people to share the burden that this situation creates. And that\u2019s OK. There\u2019s nothing wrong with allowing <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201871\">people to help. People feel good when they can help. They want to be able to support you.

(Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018B\">THERAPIST: It is. And you\u2019re being really strong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I also need to have a conversation with my advisor, probably next week, when things start again. And ask [him, like] (ph), can you support me in this? [Do you need me to go] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018F\">THERAPIST: And I can support you. In figuring out what you want to do, they will probably want some letters, you know, whether it be from me or from Linda (sp?). Did you see -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20191\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t been able to get an appointment with her until February.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20193\">THERAPIST: I know you were looking also to think about maybe seeing somebody outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20195\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I still haven\u2019t talked to hear about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20197\">THERAPIST: OK. But you have the meds you need for now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20199\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Chuckles) I almost wish I hadn\u2019t called the guy. I mean, it was really great to go to sleep in the hospital, but now I have this recurring prescription for Ambien. I guess he wrote refills, which Linda (sp?) never does. Which is nice. Like, I don\u2019t want to have a supply of Ambien that <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201991\">continues forever. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2019B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t write the refills forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m sure not, but I keep getting calls from CVS like, \u201cYour refill\u2019s ready.\u201d (Chuckles) I don\u2019t know. At a certain point, they stop working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Well, have you been taking them every night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A1\">CLIENT: No, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A3\">THERAPIST: No, so don\u2019t worry about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A5\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Sounds like you\u2019re being, you know, careful and thoughtful in your use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t know what it says about me that they don\u2019t always work, because it seems to be about as hardcore of a sleep drug as you can get, at least (inaudible 46:54) (laughter).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess it depends sort of where your level of anxiety is. And how frequently you\u2019ve been taking them you can build up a tolerance. But you\u2019re not taking them every day, so it\u2019s you know, unless you\u2019re taking it consistently, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re going to build a tolerance <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201AB1\">really noticeably. But sometimes the anxiety just might be overwhelming, you know, the medication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201AD\">CLIENT: Well, I guess they don\u2019t keep you asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201AF\">THERAPIST: No, they help you fall asleep. But a lot of times, the sustained deep sleep is lacking still.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B1\">CLIENT: Right, right. No, definitely. I mean, I think it was last week I took a couple in a row, and I was still pretty tired. (Chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, sometimes people do report kind of feeling groggy the next morning when they\u2019ve used sleep medication to fall asleep. Or cloudy (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B5\">CLIENT: It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve noticed any, like, after effects. (inaudible 47:54) being pulled to sleep. Been a long time since I\u2019ve even felt that. It\u2019s more like I\u2019m laying there and I fall asleep quicker than I would otherwise, which could be, like, an hour or so otherwise, or more. Oh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201B51\">I just forgot what I was going to say. Oh, I still feel like I didn\u2019t ever fall asleep solidly (ph) when I wake up.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N201B4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561825\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and it might be that you\u2019re just really not getting that deep, restorative sleep that you really do need.
