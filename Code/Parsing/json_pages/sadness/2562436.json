Tomorrow is the 9th; today is the 8th, so yeah. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Things are just the same in terms of I haven\u2019t really been thinking too much about what I want or how I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m just kind of doing things or trying to keep busy. (long pause)  I guess right now it seems like I just want to stay in this mode or want to make sure that I\u2019m doing the things <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">I can to stay positive or be productive and doing things. (long pause)  The only thing that\u2019s really on my mind is I\u2019ve been reading this book called The Goldfinch. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I have heard of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: You might or might not have read it. My roommate read it and gave it to me. It\u2019s kind of an epic book. It\u2019s like 800 pages and I\u2019m almost done with it. The main character, we kind of follow him through his childhood and [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:57)  He\u2019s doesn\u2019t really do life well and he\u2019s always <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">got problems or he\u2019s creating problems himself and I just kind of get angry at him for not getting out of these situations or taking better care of himself or something. I\u2019ve just been thinking about that book. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">I talked to my sister and brother a little bit. I guess he\u2019s seeing doctors and he\u2019s trying medication, but he doesn\u2019t really like it. (pause) It\u2019s kind of hard to talk to him about this stuff because he gets so negative in terms of like when he tried Lexapro or something and it made him feel sick; <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">so he stopped taking it. Maybe he was going to go to the doctor to try something else. He was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to take medication.\u201d I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, but if you don\u2019t take medication,\u201d because I know he doesn\u2019t exercise.  My brother says, \u201cWell, I stand for 40 hours a week.\u201d He works in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">coffee shop. He\u2019s like, \u201cMy joints hurt. Swimming, biking, whatever, costs money.\u201d Blah, blah, blah \u2013 every excuse. It\u2019s hard to motivate him to find something that will make him feel better. There is this resistance, I guess, so it\u2019s hard to be helpful when everything is shot down. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I imagine you get annoyed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Right. But I kind of understand where he\u2019s coming from. I know the feeling of trying things and nothing seems to work or everything costs a lot of money. It seems impossible or something. I understand where he\u2019s coming from.  (long pause) I guess it\u2019s still just wait and see what\u2019s going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">happen.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I guess I imagine it feels like a bit of a risk to talk about some of the things that you are bring up, like your novel or your brother, and that you may be worried that something that comes up or that I point to could throw you out of this protective mode that you\u2019ve been in.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Maybe a little. I just don\u2019t have very much to say about either one or I haven\u2019t spent time. Like I\u2019ve been thinking about the book, but I haven\u2019t really thought of an idea or I haven\u2019t been harping on my brother.  (long pause)  I guess nobody is going to [ ] (inaudible at 00:17:25) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">in terms of how much to say about it or . . .

I don\u2019t know. I guess I don\u2019t have anything more to say about it other than what\u2019s happened and that happened and analysis [ ] (inaudible at 00:19:18) about it.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I assume that part of the implication there is that that feels somewhat like something is missing for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Right. I mean I guess I\u2019m just in this doing mode and I\u2019m trying not to worry or think about things.  I guess it makes things easier. (long pause)  It\u2019s good because there are so many things to do at work. At home it\u2019s easier to think about or focus on something to do just so I don\u2019t feel bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">about doing nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: You feel like there is a bit of anxiety in your efforts to stay focused on stuff, like it\u2019s a way you\u2019re protecting yourself or coping? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Not that it\u2019s bad to get things done, but that\u2019s not all that\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. On Friday, I worked out during lunch, but then afterwards I was just really tired from working out and drained and it was really hard to focus. Friday afternoon was hard. Now I\u2019m in the state to stay focused or productive.  It just feels like I\u2019m doing something wrong or like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">can allow myself to do things that will make me feel worse later or regret. In my mind I always go to \u201chow can I prevent that?\u201d or \u201cwhat do other people do?\u201d or if I\u2019m in that state again, what I\u2019m going to do to push through it or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yeah, your focus is a lot on how to stay out of it and get out of it because it\u2019s [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:18) agitated, [ ] that you\u2019ve done something wrong. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: That\u2019s all I seem to be focusing on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m suspect there is an aspect of it that, in this case, involves keeping some distance from me, which I\u2019m not intending to mean as part of an argument that you shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m just saying I think that\u2019s part of how this works.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Maybe in terms of self-sufficient or like [I\u2019m taking the role] (ph?) of being productive or something, but I don\u2019t know. My mind just [comes up as there] (ph?) is something I need to say or worthy of sharing or something.  (pause) I just seem stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I see. So to you it\u2019s not exactly the same, but more in the vein of not having an opinion or analysis of something? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Which I also think that feels crummy. I don\u2019t mean crummy overall, but just that sense of not having more to say or more that you feel excited or opinionated about or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I guess. I guess I feel like I need to think about something or come up with something beforehand, develop or talk about. It just feels like I need to take advantage of or better [leverage] (ph?) this, I guess.  (long pause)  I guess I was kind of thinking about Vicki and Marlowe. They\u2019ve been <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">kind of annoying me, but I guess in my mind I\u2019m like \u201cI don\u2019t want them in my life,\u201d but<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">then I\u2019m always like \u201cjust be nice\u201d or \u201cnot burning bridges\u201d or . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562436\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: I think part of what\u2019s hard to manage is you often have strong reactions to how they\u2019re treating you or what they\u2019re doing or what they have to say.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Right. I guess I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just expecting too much or want more. (pause)  I guess I\u2019m just annoyed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: What you\u2019re referring to is them. I don\u2019t have the sense you\u2019re annoyed with me, although maybe I\u2019m missing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s more like you\u2019re worried by \u2013 and either annoyed at or critical of you \u2013 that I feel as you, I think, can feel about them. Like I\u2019m expecting you to \u2013 and you\u2019re expecting you, too, I think \u2013 to have more to say or more opinions or something here.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I guess just talking I feel like there is not much to say \u2013 very stuck. That\u2019s annoying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Sure. In some ways, it\u2019s a little bit like what you were saying about your brother or the antagonist in the novel, where your brother, I guess, seems kind of stuck. In a way he\u2019s trying these things, but in a way he\u2019s pretty quick to dismiss them or shut them down or explain why they couldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">work. Even if some of his reasons are good ones, I guess the sense I get from you is that it feels like there is also something else going on, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just like there is no option of doing anything better or an alternative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: I see.
