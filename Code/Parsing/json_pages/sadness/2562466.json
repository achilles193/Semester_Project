I was real anxious to see you today. The Greek class met and decided to disband until fall and that\u2019s kind of good. One of the older women, she is kind of like I am. I\u2019m really overwhelmed by all of the material and I need to go back and learn it, and it will <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">be good to have one less commitment.  They sent me a gift card. That was very sweet, unexpected and nice. (pause) (inaudible at 00:01:33) I had an evening meeting, this committee, basically, to talk about religious formation at the church and what to do and how we should do it.  That was very exciting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">and fun, but it was long. (laughs) When I got back I was telling James about stuff there for a little bit and then I was like okay, I\u2019m going to mess around on the Internet, read a book, and go to bed. I sat down and he was like, \u201cHow do you feel about the fact of not going to couple\u2019s counseling this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">week?\u201d So we talked about whether we should stop going to couple\u2019s counseling. (laughs) I don\u2019t want to have this conversation now. So we talked about it and I was like, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not don being mad at you. This isn\u2019t over for me.\u201d We talked about that some more.  We got to a little bit better of a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D4\">place. I\u2019m like fuck, I have to have this conversation, but I was just so tired. I think doing our taxes has given James new purpose in applying for jobs. (laughs) He talked with me yesterday about some things that are opening up. He said yesterday, \u201cYou know, I haven\u2019t applied for the post docs yet <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D5\">and I could have applied for post docs. It\u2019s not a wait for a job sort of thing.  So I think what I should take away from this is that I really don\u2019t want to do a post doc.\u201d (laughs) I was like, \u201cThat makes sense to me. Okay, let\u2019s do that.\u201d There was that position and a visiting professorship at North <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D6\">Carolina State University , which is in like Raleigh, North Carolina, and they have said that they have a chemical consultant position is opening up in sustainable chemistry. Both consulting and sustaining chemistry are something James has talked about being really interested in, and that\u2019s in some <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D7\">suburb of Denver that starts with a \u201cL.\u201d  It\u2019s one of the far ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Lone Tree, Larkspur . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Fine. (laughs) Between here and Denver. It\u2019s like a half hour out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: North?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Lafayatte, Louisville . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: (laughs) I can see we\u2019re going to be here for a long time. Someplace I\u2019m actually (inaudible at 00:05:36). I was like, \u201cYou should apply for that one.\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah.  (long pause) People keep asking so, has James heard back from any job applications? And every time, like after this, I\u2019ll just be like \u201cWell, no.\u201d But that\u2019s because he hasn\u2019t sent out any job applications. (both laugh) And so being in that place . . .  I guess by \u201cthat place,\u201d I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">feeling sort of like pissed at him and sort of spiteful, like I don\u2019t like that. (pause) In the last couple of days a lot of people have sort of been affirming me in various ways. Yeah, holidays and a gift card and actually, my friend who I contact for, gave me some books as a thank you. On the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">back from this meeting last night, I was getting a ride from somebody who lives in Andover, a very nice woman.  We were talking about what my next stop was going to be like, looking for the next thing, and she was like, \u201cAre you looking at a life in the church?\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">ordination and the priesthood\u201d and she was like, \u201cOh, good,\u201d and I was like whoa \u2013 that\u2019s really cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562466\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, absolutely. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Geoffrey is coming to town this weekend, so we\u2019re going to have lunch with him. I\u2019m sort of stressed out and anxious about the whole thing. Friends of James are having a party on Saturday, also. There is just so much stuff. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you could use another day. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause)  James said that he wondered whether it was coincidental that the areas in my life where I feel like I am my best self right now are the things that he\u2019s not part of. (pause) Which I think is worth talking about. Even if it\u2019s not coincidental, even if that\u2019s the thing, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">think that, in itself, is a valid excuse for not being there with me. (chuckles) (pause)  When I was talking to Camilla, she was like quite skeptical of the way that therapy functions in society and I\u2019m trying to talk with her about that and she\u2019s not somebody who is like \u201cyou can just pull yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">up by your bootstraps.\u201d That was completely not what she was saying, thank goodness.  She was like, \u201cWell, I grew up in sort of the Denver area where every third person is a psychologist,\u201d and I think basically her idea was that we shouldn\u2019t need therapy to go through normal human processes, like normal <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">human development, and that she sees it as self-perpetuating rather than the goal being to work outside of therapy, and so me being like \u201cthat\u2019s not how I see it, but I don\u2019t actually know anything about it and I sort of explicitly try to not learn anything about it.\u201d I don\u2019t really know.  I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200254\">where I\u2019m going with this. (chuckles) I don\u2019t know. (pause) My point to her was that I would rather have any number of people being helped in ways that they don\u2019t necessarily need than to have people not be helped in ways that they need. It seems overkill seems like the better error for me, certainly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200255\">trying to find therapy in Kansas, it\u2019s a different world in here. There is just not that . . . And it\u2019s like for someone who knows how to go about looking . . . I like Camilla, in part because I think we disagree on some pretty big things, like that\u2019s good . . . (long pause) (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">I brought up the idea of a timeline again. I was like I can\u2019t; I\u2019m just not going to let this go. I just need something that\u2019s narrower than anytime between a week and a year or a timeframe, I guess. (pause) I didn\u2019t get anything. (chuckles) Basically what James said was, \u201cWell, the longer time goes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">on, it\u2019s becoming more likely that we will move soon or that something will happen soon.\u201d Like \u2013 yay! (laughs) You\u2019re really assuaging my anxiety here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: If you\u2019re not moving now, wouldn\u2019t that always logically be true?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: (both laugh) Yes. Yeah. He said he didn\u2019t want to tell me something and then have me be upset when it took longer when that wasn\u2019t how it worked.  (sighs) I said, \u201cI\u2019m not upset because we have to change plans, I\u2019m upset because we change plans and you don\u2019t tell me that that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">until it happens. I\u2019m upset because there is this silence for two months, during which I thought were the two months when you were going to be applying.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562466\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: The being in the dark part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s not just the part about being in the dark realistically, but that that\u2019s the part that he can do something about.  (long pause) I guess I wanted to tell you that things might be moving. And James said we\u2019re just going to move. (long pause)  It has seemed like James has sort of been <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">trying to disassociate his job search, which is the locust for my feeling anxious and scared, and those feelings that James is like \u201cyou feel anxious and scared about that. That doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s what\u2019s causing that or that it\u2019s my fault.\u201d I don\u2019t want to say that it\u2019s his fault that I\u2019m anxious <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">and scared, but I do want to say that maybe he could be doing things to help. But now I\u2019m like I don\u2019t know.  I feel like I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m just anxious about other things and putting them on this or whether I\u2019m really anxious about this or both. It\u2019s usually both. (pause) (inaudible at 00:20:50) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F3\">on Saturday Night Live. I just watched that little stand-up part that he did. He talked about talking to a friend who was like, \u201cWhy is my girlfriend mad at me?\u201d  And the guy was like, \u201cWell, I guess I said something and then she got her feelings hurt.\u201d It was like I said something and then she got <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F4\">hurt. (both laugh) How much more distant can you get? (long pause)  It sort of feels like I\u2019m talking about all of this and if I\u2019m really honest, there is this huge upwelling panic surrounding moving away, mostly because of you, and I don\u2019t want to deal with it. I feel like I can\u2019t. (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: It feels like it\u2019s too much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a lot.  And also I feel like that\u2019s not how I should be making decisions. I have to focus on the fact that it would be okay eventually to move rather than on the fact that I really feel like it wouldn\u2019t be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: I see. I imagine part of that is because you\u2019re worried that, among other things, talking with me about how terrified you are about moving and losing me would likely make it happen.  Or it\u2019s a little different than that. Maybe the clearer I was about that, the more likely I would walk away <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">somehow and you would lose me over that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: It does feel like that. It also feels like I\u2019d lose James. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Like I\u2019m becoming too demanding of him around this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Something about the way your panic around moving, the way you express that to him or something, will cause you to lose him? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I guess this is something like what we were talking about the other day. Maybe if he knew more about how much I mean to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: I\u2019m really afraid to talk to him about that. I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t talk to him about it, and so . . . (pause) I don\u2019t know.  Sorry, I lost what I was going to say. (pause)  It feels like I just stopped being able to think about it. Very strange.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562466\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: I guess it\u2019s hard to talk to me about it, as well. (pause) It\u2019s like there is both quality of luckiness and uncanniness to this and you\u2019re coming to rely on me and be open with me in the way that I think is one of those curious things you could have done and is also right at the heart of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">stuff related to your depression and what you\u2019ve been struggling with.  And so the threat that moving poses seems horribly unlucky in the midst of that and, at the same time, uncanny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: (crying) Yes. (chuckles) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: I kind of imagine for you that that also seems kind of inevitable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: (crying) Like well, of course this happened. It\u2019s just how my life goes. (long pause) (crying) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I guess it makes me think about how some of the things you have said reflect pieces of this, like the way that James is not being more open about where he\u2019s at or what\u2019s going on job search-wise. Like he is being more helpless, more passive, more in the dark about whether or not you\u2019ll be <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">leaving, and I was thinking about [what you were saying at the beginning of our meeting the other day,] (ph?) that whatever the realities are, this is absolutely not something you feel ready for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: Not really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: I just feel like it doesn\u2019t really matter in the same way that I need another day, but I can\u2019t actually add another day to the week. It just happens. The world doesn\u2019t care what I need. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s worse. I think, in a way it\u2019s like the people closest to you maybe don\u2019t seem to care what you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: (crying) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re certainly not doing anything about it. Let me put it this way and I guess this is what I think it is: it seems to me that you probably agree that though you don\u2019t like the way that he\u2019s being about this, it\u2019s also not like he\u2019s intending to hurt you this badly over it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I honestly think that he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s at stake for me and I don\u2019t feel like I can tell him, so then I feel like it\u2019s my fault because I can\u2019t tell him, but I just can\u2019t. (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I imagine you can\u2019t because you don\u2019t anticipate he will get it all that well or clearly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t think he would. (crying) I don\u2019t think he (inaudible at 00:37:14). (pause) (crying)  I\u2019ve said it for the last year, my relationships have been built on the idea that I might be moving any time so I can\u2019t commit. He\u2019s like, \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t follow that you then can\u2019t be fully <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">in the relationship. You can\u2019t actually develop relationships.\u201d Well, no. I think that I have, but . . . I don\u2019t know.  The way he said it, it\u2019s like he really doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here.

You\u2019re right, it\u2019s not just that he kind of lacks the context, but that it would be very hard for him to bear, to see what it was really like for you.  In <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">other words, if it was just that he didn\u2019t know, you could tell him; but I guess it feels to you as though \u2013 and maybe rightly, I don\u2019t know \u2013 there are things he wouldn\u2019t want to know or couldn\u2019t well bear.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562466\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: It seems less than not being able to bear; it\u2019s not being able to comprehend it.

(long pause)  I would imagine what you\u2019re referring to is how our relationship, and in part the way you can talk with me about what\u2019s going on with you, is so close and is a lifeline.
