<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Nothing. Not sure what to say (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">(pause) This usually is time to report on what happened (ph) last time but I feel like nothing much happened (chuckling). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t only do that. Sometimes, you talk about something that you thought about from the last time you talked, or something that\u2019s been on your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, I can\u2019t remember what we talked about last time (chuckling). I think about feeling constructive versus destructive, but I hadn\u2019t really had any thoughts about that (pause). I spent time with Chris (sp?) this week, a little more than usual, and like, it makes me sad (chuckling). He\u2019s been <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">sad because I\u2019ve been, you know, gone. So I feel guilty and responsible, but then I also don\u2019t want to give up what I think is exciting, even though it\u2019s not always exciting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">(pause) At least it was a quiet weekend, I don\u2019t know. I played squash for the first time on Saturday, so I was really tired the whole day afterwards. I\u2019d asked a friend of mine to come and join me, but he didn\u2019t, so I was just playing by myself against the wall. Feeling embarrassed because of all these <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">people, mostly guys in the gym, sounded like a champion. They were much better at it (chuckling). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">I wasn\u2019t that upset with my friend for not showing up. I asked him, \u201ccome play squash with me.\u201d This is the guy I helped with his PhD applications. He\u2019s like \u201cOkay, Saturday at noon\u201d and I said okay. We book the courts at that time that he said (ph), the time that works for you. Then he didn\u2019t come, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">but I was like, you know what? (chuckling) Why should I be like \u201cohhhh\u201d (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">(pause) I\u2019m hoping maybe I\u2019m becoming more self-reliant (chuckling), you know? (paused) Then I cooked dinner for Nelson (sp?). He\u2019s just working a lot. I just kept waiting and waiting and waiting for him to stop, so we could eat. He has a roommate now, so his roommate and his friend were playing some <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">video game while we were eating dinner. Nelson was more interested in that than this thing I spent like an hour or two hours cooking (chuckling). So I was a little disappointed but was like, \u201coh, whatever.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(pause) Yeah, so other than that it was a quiet weekend. I didn\u2019t really have any intense feelings (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Do you miss Chris?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: What does missing someone mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Well, you said he misses you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I did say that (pause). I can\u2019t miss him, because he\u2019s, like, right there, you know? (chuckling) We\u2019re very connected, like I can text him anytime and find him on GChat, or I can call him (chuckling). So I guess I don\u2019t miss him in that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">But when I see him, I do miss what we had, like (pause) the shared space, and the shared life, you know? The shared thoughts. It\u2019s like, when I revisit that, it looks a little vacant. It\u2019s like a vacant room, or something. (pause) Even when we\u2019re chatting and having fun, there\u2019s like a little bit of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">sadness around the edges, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">(pause) I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just like, I\u2019m not really feeling anything intense right now. So it\u2019s hard for me to judge my feelings. I feel like I live in those intense moments so much that the rest of the time are then dull and mild, and like, I don\u2019t know what to do (chuckling). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562668\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">(pause) But I\u2019m, like, thinking about cooking with Chris, cooking for Nelson. They\u2019re different, or the same? I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t really have an objective statement, as to, oh, this guy appreciates it more. It\u2019s not really like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">(pause) Most of them work hard (ph), so it\u2019s not like I feel ignored, well I do. But then, like, grab a book or do something to occupy myself. I\u2019m beginning to realize the onus of my entertainment or whatever (chuckling) is on me. It\u2019s not on anyone else. Because earlier I completely put it on Chris. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">Oh, I\u2019m feeling bored because I\u2019m with a boring guy (chuckling). It\u2019s not like that, because I can be bored in Nelson\u2019s company too. If he\u2019s got a busy weekend, obviously. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">(pause) I guess it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be demanding. I just want to be more conscious of what exactly I\u2019m demanding. (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">(pause) I guess I\u2019m confused about, like the love\/sex aspect (ph) of the relationships (pause). I mean, I guess I find Nelson kind of attractive, but then, he\u2019s not very experience in this matter, or he\u2019s got hangups, or he\u2019s tired. So, it\u2019s not like, you know, it\u2019s spectacular or anything like that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">And I\u2019m afraid to prod him too much or ask anything, or you know, like, experiment or anything like that. But with Chris, I can say whatever. We can be very honest and very blunt and everything with each other. We went from, like, zero to, you know (laughing), one or two or whatever. And that\u2019s because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">we had a strong relationship. I don\u2019t know if it was strong, but you know, we had a relationship (chuckling). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">Yeah, but then, I\u2019m just like, I never want him. I never want Chris. I just don\u2019t know. It gets insulated (ph) with all the other things, but then I\u2019m just like, when will all that go away? Like whatever it was, the bitterness, or the jealousy, like the subliminal I dreamed of (ph) you know? Even if <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">that\u2019s gone, and even if I resolved all the things, will our sexual kind of thing work? I don\u2019t know. Like, right now, if we tried over with this (ph), I wouldn\u2019t allow myself to do that. I feel good to him even now (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">(pause) I\u2019m not really sure how to be objective about my sexual experience (chuckling). (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:21:05)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: (pause) Well, just, I mean, this week, and when I saw him with anyone, it made me feel (chuckling). (pause) When he\u2019s, like, happy or smiling, or responsive, then I feel really good. Then when he shuts up for any reason, then I can tell he\u2019s, you know, wanting specifically not to communicate <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">that. It just really bugs me to no end. Like, I hate it. I guess it got that way, but, at one point, I didn\u2019t really recover from feeling awful until I lapsed (ph), you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">(pause) So, it still bugs me that if something\u2019s bugging him, he\u2019ll just bottle it inside and not yell at me, you know? Or talk it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">(pause) And I\u2019ve known him for so long. So I\u2019m just thinking that, you know, if I ever felt that I could build something with him. I was excited about building that thing with him, you know? I guess I never really allowed myself to think that way. And I wonder why not? It\u2019s a good feeling, I should <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">have indulged in it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562668\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">(pause) I guess when we first moved in together, he was starting a new PhD. I guess both of us were focused, or trying to focus on ourselves. We didn\u2019t really spend much time thinking about what we shared. We just went ahead and shared it (chuckling). Then I moved to New York. Again, it\u2019s like, he kept <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">coming every weekend. (pause) I didn\u2019t really pause and think. I guess when I was at MSU I was very happy and proud to introduce Chris to my professors. I felt very proud to have a boyfriend who was so smart. I\u2019d say that\u2019s where I kind of felt that we were building something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">(pause) I felt that way, and we had been together for like six months. I helped him a little bit with his research. Then, when I got back, I was just so horribly anxious about my writing and how it wasn\u2019t going anywhere, that I was just, like, not really thinking really positively about anything. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">then everything\u2019s awful. The fact that I have to get a job, and no one else was paying rent. And then Chris got a job, and I just felt, like, betrayed and stuff (chuckling). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">(pause) Then I\u2019m like, What is this? You\u2019re not my boyfriend (ph). We haven\u2019t even had sex. How can you be anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: You said that in reaction to feeling betrayed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Well, I\u2019m saying it now. I don\u2019t know if I actually said it back then. I may have. I mean, I don\u2019t really blame him for that too much. Maybe I do, but I don\u2019t think I do, because it was also my fault. I wasn\u2019t really adventurous, or didn\u2019t really initiate it. I didn\u2019t really know if I wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">to. So, I might have pushed him away on countless occasions (chuckling). Because I wasn\u2019t attracted to him, or I felt too self-conscious and low to be in the mood for it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">(pause) I was thinking about my friend, who is also a writer. She was in this deli and she\u2019s married to a writer. She\u2019s done far more successful, I guess. Her novel is already coming out, or something. I was just thinking that one of the things that might be beneficial to be with someone who is exactly <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">in the same field as that. You know, you don\u2019t really feel, every minute you do (ph), but like, in terms of comparing yourself with him, there are not that many different criteria. Because like for me and Chris, I\u2019m always feeling short when I\u2019m compared, because I don\u2019t have a PhD and all his friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200512\">do. They talk about 10-year track jobs, and, like, publishing. It seems far more I don\u2019t know, it just feels different from all the hassles that people like me with a degree have to go through. All we can do is, like, adjunct stuff. So, that\u2019s (chuckling), it pays pittance in comparison to 10-year <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200513\">track jobs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">(pause) And it\u2019s something that the anxiety and insecurity of this kind of thing, I don\u2019t think Chris will understand, you know? So, I\u2019m just wondering if my friend would have an easier time, my friend her husband, because they would understand each other better (chuckling). Like with me and Nelson, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">he makes a lot of money, and I don\u2019t. The thing is set up for me to feel kind of small (chuckling). It\u2019s rigged against me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s how you perceive it. You elevate these men, and you sort of downgrade what you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562668\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: Well, I try really hard to, like, coordinate (ph) it off and protect it, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: You can value the creativeness in what you do. And your aspirations, in doing something that\u2019s actually very difficult, and has less clear of a path or trajectory as getting your doctorate and then going through your professorship. Not to say that that\u2019s easy. But you could value that, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">you don\u2019t. Or at least, not at this moment. But then, you sort of identify it as something external. You know, externally, it\u2019s less than these other pursuits, but it\u2019s your perception. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: What do you mean externally?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Well, you say getting a PhD is inherently more valuable, or it\u2019s inherently more whatever. And I\u2019m challenging that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true. I think it\u2019s in the eyes of the beholder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, and that\u2019s what I mean. Like, to be with someone who is like you, you wouldn\u2019t be aware of all these different avenues of success, easy success. Not easy, but not as difficult a success. Just aware of them, that makes me feel kind of, I don\u2019t know, less sure of my path. I might <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">be wrong (chuckling). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: I was thinking about how you started today (ph), talking about Chris missing you by virtue of him valuing you. And now you\u2019re talking about how you feel you have lesser value than him, at least in this respect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah (pause). Oh, he has lesser value?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: No, you\u2019re talking about feeling that he has more, that you have lesser value with respect to him, in terms of your career. You started talking about how he values you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if he values me. Just like, over time, when you\u2019ve known someone for so long, and you\u2019ve shared, you miss them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">(pause) I mean, I could be a hamster (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: It is true (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I mean, you might miss a pet, but you could miss a pet very differently. But that\u2019s also a way of just saying that you have no value. You value in terms of, sort of your position, but not who you are as a person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t promote value. Just as such a, I don\u2019t know, intangible? It\u2019s just not easily graspable, it changes. How do you build value? How do you know that you\u2019re valuable to someone, or just valuable? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Well, you certainly have a concept of it, because you say that other people have more value than you. So you have a sense of what value is. You just don\u2019t usually ascribe it to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: No, I mean, society values certain kinds of people. It has its own ideas of success. So that\u2019s what I mean (chuckling). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">(pause) I guess I\u2019m learning how you become valuable (chuckling). Like, I think with Nelson, he has that (ph) attitude matters more. It doesn\u2019t matter that I spend two to three hours cooking for him. The moment he\u2019s ready to eat and I throw a tantrum. Like, I\u2019ve been waiting for you, some guy (ph). <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">Can\u2019t you put your work aside for 15 minutes? I\u2019m glad, you know. That\u2019s definitely at the end of the day, that\u2019s going to upset him, and he won\u2019t care about the food I cooked. I\u2019m learning that it\u2019s personality and your attitude, and whether you have a smile on your face. Or if you have something <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200772\">smart to say, and you take interest in other people, that means way more to them than you doing something for them (chuckling). That\u2019s just how we are, who we are. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562668\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">(pause) Even to my friend, who kept saying that oh my gosh, I owe you my life for helping me with my applications. Even all that is going to go away if I yell at him. Be like, you know, you owe me, or something, or you have to come and hang with me. What is this, you know? So (chuckling), instead of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">that, being nice to him, and being kind, and asking about his day and all that. It counts for more than doing favors (chuckling) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">But that\u2019s not always the case. I feel like there are people who are different, and I feel like Chris are different. Not that every time I go I yell at him. We might have disagreements, but it\u2019s the fact that I might always do his dishes, or clean up a little bit. I think he remembers that, and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B1\">gets registered (pause). So people do have different criteria for valuing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s different, sort of doing someone\u2019s dishes and having that person appreciate it because they feel taken care of, versus you\u2019re serving the function of a dishwasher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I mean. In other words, if you think about your value as simply the function that you\u2019re serving for someone, relationships become quite transactional. Whereas if you\u2019re doing the dishes for him as a symbol of your care, it\u2019s no longer transactional. It\u2019s not a function you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">serving, it\u2019s an expression of your care for him. And not just dishwasher, or rent payer, where you\u2019re interchangeable. Like this family, well, if you had a hamster, you\u2019d miss it, too. They\u2019re kind of interchangeable in that sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think our relationship kind of got to that point, where the rent payer, and the dishwasher and the cook were only our functions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: Well, you certainly felt that way, and you feel that way in a lot of relationships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying to change (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: I know, that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about. You absolutely are. You\u2019re thinking very deeply about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I don\u2019t know why, like, with Chris, things just got so transactional (chuckling). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">(pause) I feel like since I\u2019ve moved out or broken up with him, things are getting better (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: It seems like the distance has provided you some perspective, and also sort of developing confidence in yourself as a woman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, but it comes at a cost of him missing me and being sad. So it makes me feel a little guilty, but not too much because he\u2019s not that sad. You know, he\u2019s not, like, falling apart. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">(pause) I don\u2019t know, sometimes I think it became transactional, and it\u2019s danger of again becoming transactional because there is no, like, sexual glue, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: How would that help it feel less transactional?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Because I feel that way with Nelson in a sense that I\u2019m attracted to him. He\u2019d ask me to do something, like read his resume or something, and I\u2019ll do it (chuckling). Like, oh, I like this person, I want to do this for them. (pause) With Chris, it\u2019s not like that (chuckling). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re going to need to stop for today, okay? But I\u2019ll see you on Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Okay, see you.
