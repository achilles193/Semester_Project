I\u2019m going to be in Montana [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:13).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Let me just write that down. I may have something on Friday morning this week at 9:15.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a little too late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Today is the 12th, so it\u2019s the 20th? Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Work is demoralizing right now.  I don\u2019t know if I told you this, but the project I was supposed to work on from December 13 until August 14 got canceled, so they just threw all of the architects on the project we were supposed to start working on in August; and, of course, the project plan <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">architect was not expecting 100 architects eight months early. So the project architect didn\u2019t have any work for us to do, so we\u2019ve all been kind of wandering around aimlessly trying to do things that are semi-useful. At my manager\u2019s level, all of the managers are being pressured because we\u2019re in this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">weird situation where the project I\u2019m working on now, is the follow-on to another project, but it isn\u2019t done and is behind schedule. It is still in the early phase of the project when they were expecting to be in the middle phase by now, so we can\u2019t build off of Zen because there is nothing there to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">build off of. So we\u2019re just kind of like . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">My mentor there, Brian, actually has been using that gesture a lot in meetings with the bosses to explain why he\u2019s not doing anything right now. Anyway, work is demoralizing, but (sighs) my boss has made a couple of comments about how I\u2019m distracted at work and use the Internet too much and I look like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">I\u2019m not engaged, so I\u2019m trying really hard not to Internet at work and not to look at my phone. My boss notices and comments on that if I\u2019m looking at my phone a lot or on the Internet a lot. It\u2019s hard, because I don\u2019t really feel like I have anything to do and my boss, Chris, finally gave me a task <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">last week and gave me a deadline and Brian did it, also, and finished it half a day earlier than I did. Honestly, I could have finished it two days earlier than the deadline Chris gave me if I had been working, not at some theoretical peak efficiency, but even at what I know is my personal average efficiency <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B3\">\u2013 not even my personal fast pace. I\u2019ve been far below my average for a while now.  (pause) I\u2019ve kind of had a bit of a [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:17) persona instead of (chuckles) doing any work. [She said it doesn\u2019t suck.] (ph?) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I guess at work, in a way it\u2019s like nobody is really doing their job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I don\u2019t know. This is the longest I\u2019ve ever held one job before. I don\u2019t hate it, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m very good at it and I feel like I\u2019m just building up this massive amount of ill will towards myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: From other people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yes.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I do wonder in my usual sort of way, whether it also feels like neither of us are doing our jobs here. What I have in mind is I don\u2019t imagine that you really think that I\u2019m not doing my job, that I\u2019m not listening or that I have nothing to say or that I have no idea what\u2019s going on with you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">or anything like that, but I could imagine, at another level, things aren\u2019t getting better as quickly as you want, I bet, and there are still things that you\u2019re struggling quite a lot with \u2013 work and sleep, I imagine, and other things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562162\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Part of that is my fault because medication would help, but I haven\u2019t called \u2013 is his name [Dr. Peabody?] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: In Concord.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: And I could have called him and scheduled an appointment. I don\u2019t know. The phone is really intimidating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Do you want his e-mail? Would that make a difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yes, please. I didn\u2019t realize he did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: I think so. I think I have an address for him that is like [doctornPeabody,] (ph?). I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s a work e-mail. I\u2019m sorry. I hadn\u2019t realized \u2013 which I should have, I guess \u2013 that might have made the difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll take a minute at the end just to make sure that I write that down.  So you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re doing all of your job either, but I suspect that you feel kind of like both. Again, I don\u2019t know if there are also ways that you kind of feel like I\u2019m not doing what I should <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">be doing, but I do imagine it in this sense of I\u2019m not getting better as I want to as fast as I want to. (both chuckle) Brian, what the hell? At that level, I imagine you feel some of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: There is also another level where I don\u2019t actually believe I will ever get better. It\u2019s just always going to be a horrible struggle.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: From that vantage point, this feels like an exercise in futility?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Well, no. It\u2019s an exercise in coping skills, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I see. So it\u2019s not like something will ever change; it\u2019s more like fundamentally how you feel and how things go won\u2019t change, but maybe you\u2019ll have some better ways to deal with it or manage it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause)  I\u2019ve been depressed and have had problems with motivation and apathy and lack of engagement with what I\u2019m doing since I was a teenager pretty consistently. There have been good days and even good weeks, but there hasn\u2019t been a reasonably long span of time where I haven\u2019t felt cripplingly, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">crushingly unable to have a life. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: I imagine you feel actually kind of fairly sure that that won\u2019t really change. (pause) In that way, kind of hopeless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yep. (pause)  But really, is feeling hopeless such a bad thing? Maybe it\u2019s just a function of the depression, but I kind of feel like false hope is even worse than feeling hopeless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Sure. Sure. I guess another way of putting it would be that seems realistic rather than deluding yourself. In other words, you would be deluding yourself if you were [ ] (inaudible at 00:12:59). (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Even though I don\u2019t expect that I will ever actually get better, I don\u2019t think these sessions are a waste of time because if nothing helps, coming here and unpacking things makes me better able to get through my week. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: I imagine it must feel to you as though I\u2019ve then been a bit deluded if I thought things could change. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: No. That\u2019s your job, right? Things can change and you can be an actor in that change.  That\u2019s kind of what you\u2019re here for, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562162\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s complicated in that I guess what I\u2019m pointing to, what I imagine, is the sense that you have that we\u2019ve seen this differently. In other words, for you, to cope a little better and attack stuff in a way that lets some air in and makes the week easier. It is absolutely a good thing and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">it\u2019s unfortunate that things won\u2019t more basically change, but that still helps and that\u2019s still good.  I guess I imagine that you have seen me as having grander visions and, I guess, what I\u2019m interested in is what I imagine is that discrepancy in your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: I actually haven\u2019t [ ] (inaudible at 00:16:23) until just now. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: I guess one reason I\u2019m mentioning it and that I think about it is because I think that must be familiar. If it\u2019s there, even if you haven\u2019t thought about it, and maybe it just isn\u2019t there and I\u2019m kind of barking up the wrong tree, I imagine that might be a familiar feeling for you in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">sense of knowing how bad or hopeless things are in the way that the people around you don\u2019t seem to know. I guess it seems like it could be or, at least, for you, if not in general.  I imagine that to be part of your depression and maybe another way to put it is part of [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:14) for you. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: There is a part of me that still is astonished that I\u2019m still alive. I spent all of my teenager-hood and most of my 20\u2019s expecting that I would kill myself before I turned 30, and yet I\u2019m still here and am going to be older in a month.  (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: You figured you would just get old enough to just be sure you were done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: No, not even. I couldn\u2019t imagine being able to hang on that long.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Maybe a little like what you were saying about your job, that it\u2019s demoralizing and you feel like you\u2019re building this mountain of ill will, and yet somehow it\u2019s lasted longer than other jobs you\u2019ve had before which, I guess, is kind of surprising. Like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yep. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: [Just take a second while I send you the e-mail and process it.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll try to be on time next time. Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m pretty sure this is fine. Doctor L. Peabody.
