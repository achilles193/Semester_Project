I hope it goes well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED\">THERAPIST: (chuckle) Oh, thanks. Me too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EF\">CLIENT: Marriage seems tricky at times. (pause) A general rule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah don t we know? (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Don t we know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no; you re right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F7\">CLIENT: They are; they can be tricky. (pause) Yeah, what were we talking about last week? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Let s see, yes. What are you thinking? Where <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FB\">CLIENT: Sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what are you thinking? What did we talk about? Anything come to mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FF\">CLIENT: No, I just felt like (pause) not like I guess just from like an analytical perspective, I ll share with you. Just like in that little conversation there; like Sam seemed to (pause) illustrate to me like one of the ways in which, you know, we can have a conversations at any rate about things <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200FF1\">that I could never really have conversations with other people about. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20101\">That seemed like one kind of (pause) point at which I was maybe talking with a friend or something; I would imagine you would share more with me about what you were thinking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20103\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20105\">CLIENT: I would feel more comfortable asking you questions in that perspective. So I guess I felt our conversation would come up against that wall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20107\">SPEAKER 3: Oh I see, yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well what does that I guess, what does that mean to you?  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010B\">CLIENT: A wall. I mean (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Yeah what (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010F\">CLIENT: I guess it s just one of the ways that (pause) it s another way that I guess I just kind of realized something that I ve already kind of realized, which is that well just like I said, like there are things that, you know, that I can discuss and talk about here with a degree of kind of openness; <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2010F1\">I can that I wouldn t be able to with some of my friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20111\">THERAPIST: Mm-mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20113\">CLIENT: You know, and (pause) within the realm of things that distinguish this kind of discussion from discussion with my friends; that s just kind of like another distinguishing feature. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20115\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20117\">CLIENT: I don t know. I mean that seems kind of common place to me at this point. I think it was something I struggle with more, or tried to resist a little bit more.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20116-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20116-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735442\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20119\">THERAPIST: (chuckle) Oh yeah. Well yeah; tell me. I mean I got the sense that, you know, (pause) yeah, I wonder if you even I was even thinking about it in terms of like how in some ways, you know, I was just thinking about it when you asked me, What do you remember from last session? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011B\">And thinking about how that in a way is a kind of yeah, question. What I m sensing is, it s a way of wanting to kind of know me a little bit more, or to know where my heads at, or you know, who I am more. In a way that like you don t feel access to.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011D\">CLIENT: Absolutely; yeah, I mean I guess I (pause) I guess like when I say (pause) that whole dynamic is something that I think I struggled with more. I m just thinking in my head; I can remember thinking that, and wanting to like get into those that mean special with you a lot more often when you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2011D1\">were at your other place on (inaudible at 00:14:28).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011F\">So when I think about that, I remember kind of being there. (pause) Like I don t think I have any less interest. But I guess I just kind of, you know, wedged some space in between the fact I m still interested in it. And the fact that it s something to get right from (inaudible at 00:14:53) or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20121\">Like it doesn t it s something I kind of accepted or something. Or maybe it was because I felt really at loss for what else to talk about, so I was just like, you know, earlier on something that was one more thing that I felt like was, (pause) like a conversation that we couldn t have or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201211\">I don t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20123\">SPEAKER 3: You know now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20127\">CLIENT: But I felt like right there, I felt like I didn t really feel all that, you know, anxious; I didn t change the trajectory with the conversation, because that was -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no it didn t seem like that to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012B\">CLIENT: I felt you were nervous; I felt you were a little anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Mm-mm. (pause) Yeah, no; yeah, I think -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012F\">CLIENT: Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20131\">THERAPIST: Well I tend to be I tend to be more concerned about if yeah, there s probably an anxiety about me (pause) being (pause) I guess like, you know, in my mind that in some ways I feel like one side of it, and this is not the whole thing, but one side of it, is what I said, Yeah, I have this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201311\">girlfriend. I thought that s a lot to tell somebody. In a way, it s not at all, but in another way, it can be. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20133\">And, you know, it s not (pause) yeah, I tend to feel like (pause) kind of the tricky kind of quality it can be about how much I talk about myself or not aside, when you start talking about when your analyst says that they re anxious and ambivalent about something. (chuckle) It s kind of a lot to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201331\">throw at somebody. (pause) I don t like to do that to people, and they would sign off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah, no sure; yeah, yeah. I mean I like in crude way, the problem is, people don t (pause) I mean I don t pay to come here anymore, but people don t pay to come here to hear about what you re feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20137\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20139\">CLIENT: I mean in a really crude way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013B\">SPEAKER 3: Now you ve got to worry about -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013D\">CLIENT: I suppose if you really wanted to, you could probably take up a 50-minute session ahead, talking about that stuff if you wanted to.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2013C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735442\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">SPEAKER 3: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">CLIENT: Like I mean (pause) yeah. I think I agree with you that I think those types of things certainly have the potential to be pretty significant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20143\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20145\">CLIENT: I mean I ve often even wondered if like you were gay, or if you were straight, or you know, if you took like a wedding ring off when you came to work something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20147\">THERAPIST: Mm-mm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20149\">CLIENT: And I assumed, I mean just in terms of like my thinking, I assumed that you had a girlfriend.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, you know, I guess it s more the not just learning about it, but I was thinking also the shock of me saying it and telling you. (chuckle) You know, I guess that s what I was concerned that I realized I said, Yeah, well -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20151\">CLIENT: Do you feel like it s slipping out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20153\">THERAPIST: No, not really; no. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20155\">CLIENT: Yeah? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yeah, if anything slipped out, it s more my response to that I would say. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20159\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Well I thank you for being so conscientious of (pause) how your (inaudible at 00:19:27). And I appreciate that, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D\">CLIENT: But it is really nice to hear you say that about going to see parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause) What; yeah, tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20161\">CLIENT: What? It s just great to hear. I mean I ve been there talking to you about, you know, just painted pictures; monsters that our parents feel like. That s where we were talking about last week; we were talking about my dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20163\">THERAPIST: Mm-mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20165\">CLIENT: That s what we were talking about. Now I remember. Because I think I probably characterized him as a monster in the most explicit terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20167\">SPEAKER 3: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20169\">CLIENT: That s it, and then I was (pause) telling, what is it? I was (pause) I was talking a little bit, you know, about how it kind of made me a little uncomfortable to say that stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016D\">CLIENT: Yeah it is, because I realized that I didn t really show you [where I had my office set up] (ph). You know, my dad s [far out again] (ph), because they would have professionally ran into him and stuff. And that s what we talked about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20171\">CLIENT: That really, really lost a place in my memory, but I really was not didn t work all that great with me. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20173\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20175\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like I even I don t even remember I m surprised now that I don t even remember talking to my dad during the week, which I did, but I don t remember doing it. And feeling like I feel like that s so much forgotten; I feel like I m surprised that I didn t feel weird talking to him like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201751\">I m in training or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20177\">THERAPIST: Oh; oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20179\">CLIENT: Well because truly, some things slip out of mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, well if you follow that now, what do you make of the forgetting? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2017D\">CLIENT: (pause) I left the air feeling a little uncomfortable. I noticed that it s something that made me uncomfortable to talk about in the terms that I was talking about it. (pause) I think I even told you, Don t repeat this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Don t repeat this; yes. (overlapping voices) No, but why did you need to say it then do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20181\">CLIENT: Because I think it was the (pause) it was the idea, (pause) you know it s more to say quietly, so he doesn t hear it or something. Like that s the discomfort, right. Because it s not thinking that stuff; it s not like sometimes I say things, right. And it s then like the first time I say <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201811\">them out loud, it s the first time I even think about them in those terms. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20180-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20180-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735442\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20183\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20185\">CLIENT: Like that s the thing I ve experienced here; that was very different last week. I had absolutely thought about it in those terms very clearly for a very, very, very long time, you know? But it was literally just like talking about it; saying it out loud that made me feel uncomfortable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20187\">THERAPIST: Well as you were describing too, there was some way of I mean one maybe, but I don t think you mentioned this at the time, but maybe it s part of what your experience was of betrayal. But I think one thing that you were linking it to was, or we linked it maybe to or maybe that I kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201871\">of wondered about was well the link was a bit between not wanting him to come around the office, because of the kind of associations they might draw between him and you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20189\">CLIENT: No. I mean very much, you know, another crude analogy, but very much like the friend you re embarrassed by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018D\">CLIENT: Like you know, like the football games when you re with your other friends or something. Like it s very much that kind of <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Because it reflects back on you somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20191\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20193\">THERAPIST: It feels like it does, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20195\">CLIENT: Yeah. It really feels like it s a secret, you know, or something that I m ashamed of or something I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20197\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well the other thing I was wondering about, that I had kind of wondered, was that if you felt this certainly wasn t my conscious intention, but if you felt in any way that I was pushing it; I was putting you on the spot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20199\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I don t feel that you were pushing it. I didn t feel at all like you were steering the conversation in a place that made me feel uncomfortable. And I felt very in control of the conversation. And I wanted to be talking about it, despite the fact that it made me kind of uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019B\">But what struck me was that how kind of like surprised you seemed when I said this stuff, you know. I think you said like, I never heard you talk about it in these terms. Like it seemed like I will lose you or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019F\">CLIENT: And like that shocked me, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A3\">CLIENT: It s like it s just one of those moments where I guess I m (inaudible at 00:25:05).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A5\">SPEAKER 3: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A7\">CLIENT: I m saying things different than the things that I m thinking. It s because the degree and the frequency I think about that stuff, it just kind of surprised me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, kind of like it was like how could you not know this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AB\">CLIENT: Or like how in the hell am I going to talk about this? Yeah, or how could I not mention it?
