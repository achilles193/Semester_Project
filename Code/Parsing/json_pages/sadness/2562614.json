Eh, it my answer on the success of that. Anyway\u2026 (pause) So, I\u2019m conflicted as to how much preface to give the following questions, so I\u2019m going to give <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">them exactly this preference. So, have you gotten married?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Congratulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Is your spouse biologically male or female?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Where did that what does that it\u2019s an interesting question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: (laughs nervously) I\u2019m happy to talk about why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I\u2019m happy to answer it. I\u2019m just curious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Oh, okay. I guess can you you sort of phrased half a question. Would you mind like, so where does that come from, is that the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah, like what what is your thinking in asking that question or where do you of all the questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Is, you know, I\u2019m reminded of your response to my question of why did you become a therapist. I\u2019m not exactly sure I can access the internal state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Right, right, yeah that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: But it is a thing about which I have been curious for a long time. So, why am I curious about that in particular? I think it\u2019s an important part of identity. I\u2019m sort of curious as to who you are, or something like that. Not that it so the thing is, like it\u2019s not actually important to me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">what the answer is, but I\u2019m curious about it. Does that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: I mean basically, you\u2019re curious if I\u2019m gay or straight, I mean crudely, that\u2019s the terms people use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yes, I\u2019m curious about that also. (pause) Yeah, I think yes is a sufficient answer there, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Is that something that you tend to be curious in general about with people or is there something particular about me that you think about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: In general, I\u2019m curious, because it\u2019s sort of an important part of people\u2019s identity. Most people, there\u2019s not a lot of question one way or the other, for one reason or another. There\u2019s context to meeting them, so it\u2019s clear relatively quickly. The context to meeting you is that you are an intelligent <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">woman in and around academia, who clearly espouses some feminist views and also has interests in lesbian psychology, and lives in the city of Denver. So, I would say the odds are eh, don\u2019t know. Certainly being pregnant raises a different set of questions, but it doesn\u2019t actually speak to this question, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200372\">because there\u2019s\u2026 But answering this question then tells me a lot about your pregnancy, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Well, so if you were gay, then you were trying to get pregnant. If you were not, you were not necessarily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: But it sounds like the books, there\u2019s something about the books that made you think about it, looking at my reading books.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Oh, no, sorry, I gesture them because it\u2019s easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: But you were referring to seeing my books on lesbian psychology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Sorry, that\u2019s also on your interests on your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Oh, is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Or, on one of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Maybe I\u2019ve conflated the two a little bit but yeah, you definitely you know, you have The Advocate in your office, that\u2019s the name of the magazine.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562614\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: But, yeah, the books also. I told you, (shaky voice) when we first started that they were like distracting in some sense, because they\u2019re there and they tell me something about you. It\u2019s like this whole other field of information that is open to me here that wasn\u2019t when I was sitting over there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Right, right. Well, he is biologically male.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Okay. Were you trying to get pregnant?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Congratulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">[PAUSE: 00:07:50 to 00:08:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that concludes my question. Oh, there\u2019s the other one, the other big one. So, my mother was also 42, or she had a child at 42 also, but that was her fifth child so it\u2019s a different story. You know, that\u2019s a preface to saying, like I know something about pregnancy at your age and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">I also know something about first pregnancies, because both of my sisters have had a first pregnancy and a lot of my friends. So, are you okay, has this been hard? Is the baby okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m really okay, but it is my first pregnancy, but I\u2019m curious about you\u2019re assuming that it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Oh, I asked you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Oh, did you already ask?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, I asked if this was your first child and you said it was your first biological one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right, I did say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: You had a couple of stepchildren, which is why I asked if you had gotten married already, because that sort of implies that you had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: That I had gotten married. Well, I think I\u2019ve referred to them as my stepchildren for a while but yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Okay. That I wasn\u2019t sure about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, I\u2019m okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: In what ways would you think about my not being okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: To hear other people tell it, pregnancy can be challenging, physically and emotionally. You\u2019ve been doing it. I feel like I don\u2019t need to tell you, like what, what might have been hard. You know, the small risks of a wide number of diseases go up, both with first pregnancies and with older mothers <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">and fathers. So, those are sort of the medically, I guess, is the one word answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: So, am I okay, is the baby okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yesterday, you suggested that I was protective of you, and that\u2019s certainly true. I am also concerned about you and curious about you. These are so, um. And today, I feel like instead of not expressing my curiosity, in order to protect you from it, I am expressing it and letting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D1\">you to respond how ever you want to. So. But this was the harder thing that I didn\u2019t do yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Harder? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: Harder than telling you about knowing some more things about you than I had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: And harder because you\u2019re worried about asking too much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s yeah. I think that covers most of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: What does it feel like, knowing more?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: It feels nice. There\u2019s some relief, because nothing catastrophic has happened, by virtue of asking. There\u2019s also, you know, it\u2019s I am glad that you are doing okay. I\u2019m glad to know a little bit more about you, not that it tells me in some sense, not that it tells me very essential about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200891\">you, but they also seem like\u2026 I guess I am of two minds and I\u2019m expressing both simultaneously as to whether I know you or not. I feel very much like I do know you. One of the interesting things about reading some of the things you\u2019ve written is that your voice is very consistent between those different <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200892\">my different exposures to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562614\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: So, thank you for answering the questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Sure. Does knowing any of those answers sort of change the way you think about me or fill in a picture differently? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Only knowing that you were trying to get pregnant, when you were not yet engaged. That, I guess raises the other questions. That\u2019s very interesting. That presumably says something about your interests or values, but I don\u2019t know exactly what and I\u2019m curious about it. It\u2019s not that I had left <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">that outside of the possibilities, but it was not one that I had sort of thought was high in likelihood. Anyway\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: It seems different than your interest or values.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Historically, certainly, but one of the reasons that we\u2019re here is that my values seem to be in some sort of flux or a logjam or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: How?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Or to have hit a point where too many of them conflict for me to be able to figure out what I should or want to do. (pause) And it also sort of raises the possibility that this is a longstanding desire of yours, that has finally come to pass. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m very happy for you. I\u2019m still <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">happy for you if it\u2019s not.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you\u2019re working hard to try to put my experience together somehow, see how it all fits together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Is that you phrase that like that\u2019s not something that you would assume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Not necessarily. I\u2019m just kind of trying to name it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Okay, naming is good. Yeah, definitely, that\u2019s sort of like\u2026 On most subjects, I am fairly curious and you\u2019re a subject that has grown increasingly important to me, so I\u2019ve perhaps grown increasingly curious, but it\u2019s not like I mean these are all longstanding curiosities and the shortest <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">standing ones relate to your pregnancy, because that\u2019s the newest thing on the list, I guess. So I guess I am also seeking greater intimacy with you, I think is a way of describing that.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">Well, I do think that people can have a great deal of intimacy in entirely anonymous situations or nominally anonymous. That\u2019s (pause) I don\u2019t know how to end that sentence, so I guess I\u2019m just acknowledging if it\u2019s possible in other ways then, knowing more about you, but this is a way in which I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">am seeking intimacy I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">[PAUSE: 00:19:11 to 00:19:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">Do you feel like it\u2019s something that you\u2019re seeking because it\u2019s important in its own right, given sort of our relationship and work together? Do you feel like it\u2019s also something that you\u2019re seeking because it feels like it\u2019s lacking in other areas of your life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yes. I think that\u2019s exactly right. And in some sense it\u2019s important in our work because it\u2019s lacking in other areas, both. You\u2019ve suggested for some time that our work can help with loneliness, I think. I interpret that to mean both immediately and also in a developmental sense. I told you about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB1\">the guy who says you make your own luck yesterday, but there\u2019s a sense in which this project is one of remaking luck. To hang on to that all the time, more than because I\u2019m really attached to the idea. I can see, you also see at that time, regarding trust, practice was a thing that we could do. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB2\">I think that\u2019s all of that is playing into this. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562614\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: So maybe it would also be helpful to focus on that loneliness and what feels like is lacking in your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s right. I guess I did open saying I was conflicted as to how much preface to give, but one of the prefaces I thought about was saying I feel very lonely. But, I felt like that, saying that at the beginning colors the context of the questions, in a sense of like, I don\u2019t know, asking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">you to do this thing because I am lonely or something, as opposed to like that might put more pressure on you to respond in a particular fashion, which (nervous chuckle) I haven\u2019t asked many of these things before because I don\u2019t know where your boundaries are, and I certainly want to ask them in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF2\">context that might place more pressure on your boundaries in some sense. Not that I actually think that you can\u2019t take care of yourself. I\u2019m pretty confident that you\u2019d refuse to answer if you didn\u2019t want to answer, or demur in another way that was not quite so, harsh perhaps, but\u2026 Sorry, that\u2019s a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF3\">of talking, sort of tangentially related to the suggestion you actually made, of talking about the loneliness, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: So my (hesitant) I\u2019ve been talking to both my parents and my older sister a lot more in the last several months. My parents, because so, I see my friend Franco a couple times a week. We go for a walk on Tuesdays and then we and Tanya have a game\u2019s night on Saturdays, and that\u2019s really good, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">but we do particularly the walk we do regularly, because we sort of schedule it and do it. So, I was coming to see you regularly and so I was seeing you ever week and I see my advisor every week, but let me talk to my parents. I haven\u2019t a lot for a long time, because they never call me because they <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B32\">don\u2019t want to bother me or something. I\u2019ve never been quite clear why. I don\u2019t call them, in part for the same reason, because I sort of know what their daily schedule is like and often the times that it\u2019s convenient for me to call, it\u2019s dinnertime at home. You know, so I have been talking to them more <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B33\">frequently and that\u2019s been both good and bad, it\u2019s been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: It\u2019s hard to (pause) it\u2019s hard to talk to people every week and not talk about some of the most important things. I don\u2019t talk with my parents or with my sister about divorce. I mentioned that I had talked some with my dad but he brought it up. Anyway, so Vivienne, I\u2019ve been talking to more <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">frequently because I actually can\u2019t remember if I told you this, but so her husband is a police officer in the town that we grew up in and one of his other officer\u2019s wives was hit by a car and killed while running along a road near their house, in January I think. Did I tell you that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Mm-mm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Okay. So that was really traumatic for Vivienne, who knew her, and also, I mean there\u2019s like 16 police officers in the town, so it\u2019s not a large town anyway. So that really like shook Vivienne in many of the ways that, you know, nearby death shakes people. I expect you\u2019re used to those more <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">so than I am, sort of like the idea that like this is it and it could end any time. I felt like she often is contained by her fears or apprehensions or something, so as a result of that has sort of been working very hard to not put off things that she wants to do. It\u2019s a horrible situation but that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB2\">a really good thing that has come out of it for her. So anyway, so she\u2019s been calling me regularly. We set a time and she calls me, because that\u2019s something she really wants, and I want it also, but I have a hard time telling her the important things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562614\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">Anyway, so we talked yesterday. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve given you quite so much introduction to all of that. It seemed important to say, but less so in retrospect. Yeah, I don\u2019t really have anything more to say than we talked some yesterday. I\u2019m very curious about her internal life and what\u2019s going on <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">for her and talking about that with her. She\u2019s curious about mine also but I\u2019m more reticent to discuss it. So, we talked briefly about that at the end and she sort of said well, I feel like I\u2019ve talked this whole week, or this, this all the time today. Not all the time, but I\u2019m curious about what\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD2\">going on with you. Yeah, but I feel like this happens a lot. I was like yeah, that\u2019s probably not just you. Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">(shaky voice) Learned early on, I can remember conversations with my dad about this action when I was a teenager, to how to prompt someone else to talk so that I didn\u2019t have to, which makes for really awkward conversations with my dad because we\u2019re both doing that and so neither of us is talking. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF1\">We\u2019re getting better at that. Anyway, so she concurred that not only was that what was going on, but she had noticed that that was going on also, it\u2019s just that she was not able to stop it from happening in some sense. So that was nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: What do you think that reticence is about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: So, when you came up the stairs to the office today, I have in my pocket, an envelope, so on the envelope, sometimes I write down things that I think about, that I want to talk with you about. So, I had that envelope in my hand at the time and my impulse on hearing a noise in the area, was to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">put away the envelope. I\u2019ve realized that\u2019s not really an answer to the question, but\u2026 (pause) You know, I\u2019m actually willing to take the envelope out of my pocket and hand it to you and let you read it. It\u2019s written so that you couldn\u2019t really infer everything that I am thinking from it. That\u2019s part <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C32\">of the point of writing it, the way that\u2019s written. But I\u2019d be very reluctant to show it to anyone else, let alone let them touch it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Have you ever thought about why your dad is like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yes, but I\u2019ve never really come up with an answer. Part of the answer, my dad, I think would give to that, is that he doesn\u2019t have very much to say. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really true but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the answer he\u2019s given several times, to sort of related questions. So I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C71\">You know, I\u2019m again, reminded of your answer to the question yesterday. You aren\u2019t sure that you ever really have access to the internal state or the internal reasons for why you became a therapist. That idea is one that I have been thinking about in the preceding week, not in those terms at all, but\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562614\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">So there\u2019s one of the fundamental ideas underlying quantum mechanics is that every molecule has a single function that describes it perfectly, and we call that the wave function for sort of historical reasons. We can never directly access the wave function but if we could, it would tell us everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">about the molecule, literally everything that there is to know. Mathematically, we can write this function, we do write this function, and then we can operate on it with other functions, and that returns back the wave function unchanged, but it also gives us a number or some other value. And for every <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C92\">function with which we can operate on the wave function, there must be a value, and that value must be observable in some way. This is sort of like a fundamental idea. So, our access to the wave function is only through perturbations of some kind. We apply an electric field or a magnetic field to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C93\">thing of interest and we are able to measure, usually an energy difference, and that tells us something about the internal state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">I don\u2019t know if that was clear at all but it seemed like it was a way for me, of apprehending that, or of relating to the idea that the circumstances that I am now in, and my responses to them, particularly my responses to them but knowing the circumstances also, tell us something about my internal <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">state and the structure of my internal whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">So I feel like one of the tools that you often, or have at least a few times used, is to change the function that you\u2019re applying, is asking how I think about someone else having a similar idea, or something like why do you think your dad does that, sort of. (shaky breath) Having said that, it seemed <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">a lot more useful in my head than it did to say out loud.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: It started with my asking the question, what do you think the reticence is about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I\u2026 (pause) The reticence is about trying to protect myself. From what? I don\u2019t have a good answer to that. I feel like there is a good answer to it but I don\u2019t know what it is, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Do you ever tell Tanya that you\u2019re lonely? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Not often. (pause) She\u2019s told me a couple of times that she\u2019s lonely. (pause) You know, there\u2019s a sense in which I used to trust her a great deal and was not lonely with her, and that\u2019s really not the case now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">You know, I feel like it takes a lot of trust or something, for me to share my internal life and I don\u2019t know why. I think it\u2019s important for us to talk about but I don\u2019t have an answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">[PAUSE: 00:37:16 to 00:38:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">Yeah, my thoughts have petered out and I\u2019m just sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Can you tell me about that sadness?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: I think it relates to the idea that I have lost a great deal of intimacy in my life and I don\u2019t see any real prospect for getting it back. There\u2019s a sense in which I don\u2019t want it back with Tanya and that\u2019s horrible, I think, but\u2026 (pause) I don\u2019t know, you believe in the truth so there\u2019s the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">truth, but I still want it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t want it with Tanya because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible or because you feel you\u2019ve been burned and you don\u2019t know if you can trust again? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562614\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: So those two are kind of entangled. So I don\u2019t\u2026 (pause) Part of the trust for me was thinking she was a particular person or a kind of person or something like that, and I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s true. I\u2019m not sure I can place my trust in a person who\u2019s intermittently trustworthy. (pause) Or <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">at least, that\u2019s I mean that\u2019s, you know, like\u2026 (sighs) If you treated trust as a signal and it does this, I feel like, or trustworthiness as a signal, it\u2019s always going to vary a little bit because people can handle different things from day to day. But with Tanya it varies, you know, it drops below <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E32\">the baseline for periods of time unpredictably, and even if it were entirely predictable, the result of it\u2019s a sense in which I can ask you these questions at the beginning of the session, because I trust that you can take care of yourself. Not like sometimes or not like if I\u2019m cautious enough and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E33\">framing it in the right way enough, you can take care of yourself, or like actually trust that you can take care of yourself. But if the signal is intermittent, then I can only trust when I was reliably predict where we are in some sense, but that\u2019s not really it\u2019s not the same thing. So I guess that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E34\">speaks to, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible with her, or for me with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: I guess I want to understand what trust means for you. So if you trusted her in a period where she\u2019s not trustworthy, what then is the result? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah, that seems like a really good question. (pause) You know it seems like the sort of large scale answer is one or both of us gets hurt. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s specific enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s something for us to think about, because that implies that you fear that or there\u2019s a sense of danger around that. So what that danger is, is very important, and does it really exist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: Hmm. Mm-hmm. (pause) Yeah, I think that\u2019s I agree, that that makes sense and that seems right. I\u2019m having a really hard time getting a grip on anything to respond with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: (pause) You know, I mean I\u2019ll start with the obvious one because I can\u2019t find anything else, but I\u2019m afraid that Tanya will die and it will be my fault. But that\u2019s not it, there has to be more than that. I don\u2019t know how to get to the other things. (pause) It seems sort of like I\u2019m afraid that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF1\">I will rely on her and be disappointed or disillusioned also, separately from the other one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Well, this, you know you were saying good reasons and bad reasons to leave Tanya and, you know, if you have trust issues, that\u2019s a bad reason to leave, because you don\u2019t trust her, you know trust issues, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: For example. So I feel like this is very much, this, what I\u2019m about to say is very particular to your issue in terms of sort of life after disappointment, that when you feel disappointed in a person or an experience, that sort of you\u2019re edging into despair, rather than believing that there <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F51\">could be life. Not necessarily, but there could be life. Being open to that possibility, I think is uniquely your struggle. (long pause) Does that make sense? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Sorry, I\u2019m just trying to process that in a way in which it\u2019s new information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Well, maybe it isn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: That\u2019s fine. You know, not everything needs to be new information. Sometimes it\u2019s still important. (pause) No, I think that\u2019s right. I think it\u2019s very deeply true, but I don\u2019t have a clear sense of what that implies about what I should do or how I should alter things or something, which may <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB1\">be a confirmation of the suggestion. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200FA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562614\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s something for us to think about for sure.
