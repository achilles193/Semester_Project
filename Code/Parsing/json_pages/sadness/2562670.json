(chuckling) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">(pause) I wonder, do I just think about the difference between constructive and destructive? I feel like I\u2019m just confused sometimes. Whether certain actions are constructive or destructive (chuckling). It\u2019s hard to tell what the motivation behind that is sometimes. I don\u2019t know. Or maybe I shouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">even be thinking in that way, in that dichotomy, in that mind wave (ph). I don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019ve just been made aware of, oh, you\u2019re in destructive mode, or you\u2019re destructive. So that\u2019s got me thinking in that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Who\u2019s saying you\u2019re in a destructive mode?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I guess a year ago, or maybe a year and a half ago, I guess. When that whole Victor episode happened, a friend of mine was saying, \u201cyou\u2019re like in a destructive mode,\u201d so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">(pause) I guess I feel that, I was thinking of that episode and that way. I guess I was out to destroy myself, and to destroy things. It makes sense. It makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">(pause) But I\u2019m just like, am I still in a destructive mode? How do I recognize that, and what does that mean? I feel like there\u2019s a lot of power. You feel very powerful when you\u2019re destroying things, it\u2019s like active. It\u2019s not something passive. Then, I\u2019m like, well, power is something positive, isn\u2019t it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(pause) Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I guess I could talk in more concrete terms, and bring examples. So, if you drink too much, is that destructive? It could be both, because it destroys your liver, or whatever, your kidney or whatever. But, like, if you were drinking socially, maybe you\u2019re making friends. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">Or if you\u2019re not making friends, then you\u2019re keeping yourself from doing something more destructive, which is constructive (chuckling). I\u2019m just getting confused. Or if you\u2019re having a good time, isn\u2019t that constructive? Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">(pause) I guess this is a bit more complicated because it has gray areas. So I think, maybe I should just do what makes me happy. And that\u2019s a much more simplistic way of looking at things. Maybe I should encourage that way of thinking. Just do what feels good, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(pause) But then it\u2019s like so impulsive. And some of my impulses are very, very drastic (chuckling). Like right now I want to drop out of school. It\u2019s just been, like, I\u2019m so frustrated with the professor\u2019s (ph) office. It\u2019s been driving me crazy. They\u2019re so inept, and it\u2019s not my thing. It\u2019s Chris\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">(sp?) thing. I\u2019m disputing this $300 late fee, and how they took it off and they\u2019re putting it back on again. I\u2019m thinking of writing a letter to the dean or whatever and protesting it. And then I\u2019m like, what the fuck am I doing in school? I\u2019m not getting anything. Maybe I should just find a job, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">get like proper healthcare and stuff, you know? (pause) So, I\u2019m kind of very impulsive in thinking I\u2019m going to drop out. I feel bad, and in the moment it will make me happy (chuckling) or powerful. Again, is it destructive to drop out of school? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: (pause) Where did you go? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I was talking myself out of dropping out (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562670\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">(pause, phone rings at 00:14:14)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Ending something or leaving something is not inherently destructive. It could be, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: What do you mean, inherently destructive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Well, I feel like sometimes you give examples of something destructive when you want to end it, you know, like leaving Chris. There\u2019s nothing inherently destructive about ending something, and you\u2019re talking about school, too. It might be, but it\u2019s not inherently that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah (pause). No, I just kind of got frustrated, like why the hell am I paying all the money? I mean, I don\u2019t have to pay much, but, you know, I understood it as like, I don\u2019t have to pay a single dime. It\u2019s turning out that last semester I paid 800, and this semester, it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">know how much. But it\u2019s fucking late fees, and it\u2019s not my fault. It\u2019s all the reading (ph), and one person says something else, another person says something else. They made me run around the whole fucking semester, and that stupid, you know, woman is like, it\u2019s your fault. And I\u2019m just like, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">fuck you. And they think that every student is just sitting on their ass, or like, smoking pot. And I\u2019m just like, you have no fucking idea. Students at Amherst\u2014they\u2019re really outliers in terms of, like, the kinds of responsibilities that are on their shoulders. Like Chris tells me these things, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F3\">I\u2019m amazed at the kind of students he has. They work ridiculous hours, and work in factories, and this and that. To have no empathy from, like, some bitch who\u2019s just sitting in the chair doing accounts, and is applying the same kind of logic to every single student, because every student is a fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F4\">number to her. It\u2019s just like, I just wanted to slap her, you know? (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">And 300 dollars is a lot of money for me, it\u2019s like half my rent. I don\u2019t buy groceries (chuckling). I eat with my mom, who eats because she gets food stamps, you know? So that makes me feel horrible, that I cannot even take care of my mom. I know it\u2019s temporary, it\u2019s only been the case for a year and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">a half, but I\u2019d like for it to not be that way. And I see this 300 dollars as, like, this fucking punishment that I don\u2019t deserve. And that the whole school is ganging up on me. Yeah, it just feels like rebelling very strongly. And then, like, I guess, talking to myself, and telling myself to calm down. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">And to focus on my priorities and be patient. The job is very easy. I don\u2019t have to do too much, and I\u2019m getting all this time to write. A few more months. Stick it out, stick it out. Tuck my tail between my legs and just accept defeat. If not defeat, then, just, whatever penalty. You know, pick my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">fights, as they say. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">(pause) I\u2019m not really getting that much attention from my teachers. It\u2019s been a few months, and I feel neglected in that regard too, so I\u2019m also a bit sad about that. Yeah, I just guess it\u2019s destructive, in that I\u2019m throwing away something that I\u2019m building. I\u2019m halfway done with this degree, and yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">I already have this degree from a more prestigious institute. I could make this work for me. I could, next year, try and teach, and get that teaching experience. So, it\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s like to make something work for you, you have to be deliberate and think about stuff very carefully, and not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">just act on impulses. But it feels so good to act on impulses (chuckling). Instantly you feel powerful. But it doesn\u2019t last. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562670\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">Yeah, and like, the thing with Chris. There\u2019s so many complications there. It\u2019s not even as simple as the school. The school is simple. It\u2019s so little emotional investment there (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">(pause) I guess, not just that, but everything. I want to understand what just makes me go off on something, or feel like I\u2019m trapped by it, you know? I think that really messes me up and makes me impulsive. Impulsive to like run away or destroy something. I guess it\u2019s really relevant to what you said <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">last time. I feel things very intensely, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll change. Chris was like, you\u2019re getting older, I\u2019d imagine (ph) you getting more mellow. I don\u2019t think so, right? I mean, I\u2019ve been seeing you for something like two years, or something, a year and a half. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Mhm. A year and a half.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Have I been less that I described to you\u2014that things feel less intense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: No, but you describe feeling more reflective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, okay, that\u2019s a change, then. I remember talking about Victor (sp?) and feeling that you have intensely felt things with him. You were like probing that, and I think I said something like, it feels good. You feel alive. That intensity, otherwise you feel dead. And then, you know, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">fight with that woman at that Thanksgiving party. I felt things intensely. But then, that small an event or that get-together, this time I was going to Nepal (ph). Definitely didn\u2019t feel it. Because that was nothing. It wasn\u2019t like a face off or anything. Because if there was, I would feel things intensely. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">But I guess I was more reflective. I wouldn\u2019t say reflective. The reflections came very, very quickly. And the things that I said were motivated by a lot of different, like, reactions to things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">(pause) But that\u2019s just, like, small. More important things, I guess I want to get a better handle on those things. Thinking of specifically, like, marriage, and why, after all these years why I\u2019ve never gotten engaged. Why that ring he asked his father to bring is still sitting somewhere in that apartment (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">(pause) And it\u2019s just my thinking of certain moments where I\u2019ve been sad, intensely said, and intensely depressed with him. And that moment just clouding everything else. Everything good, and happy, and positive. And me feeling trapped by that moment, you know? It\u2019s really just like going on an endless <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">American highway, you just never know (chuckling). It\u2019s just never-ending. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">(pause) So, like, unless I start feeling differently about those moments, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to commit for marriage to anyone. It\u2019s the way that I take those negative moments and expand, and think that they\u2019re endless, and a prison (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">(pause) But it\u2019s not just that. I mean, I think I have to admit that I\u2019m not really attracted to Chris physically. I\u2019ve never really been, and that\u2019s like a big issue. And it\u2019s got a lot to do with other things. It\u2019s not just that, oh, his body type, or whatever. It\u2019s got to do with the fact that, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">know, we don\u2019t have traditional gender roles. Or, like, I\u2019m able to really dominate him, and he\u2019s just very malleable. All these other psychological things that make me think of him as not as sexually attractive as I want (chuckling). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562670\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">(pause) I don\u2019t know if this is the place to talk about like how all that sexuality and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Why wouldn\u2019t this be a good place to talk about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I feel like I wouldn\u2019t know how to begin to articulate any of that. So, if you talk about sex, does it become that you don\u2019t want to have it? I don\u2019t know much about that (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: How would that work? That you\u2019d talk about it, and then not want to have it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Because you overanalyze it? Or analyze it? If you\u2019re aware of doing something, doesn\u2019t it trip you up? No? I guess it doesn\u2019t have to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah, trip you up how? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. Some things are deliberate, like cooking. You could describe every step, I guess that\u2019s okay. But, I don\u2019t know (pause). I guess I\u2019m just thinking, wouldn\u2019t it become mechanical? (chuckling) I don\u2019t know. Like, is there more to be said? Like, yeah, I don\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">get turned on when Chris touches me, you know? I don\u2019t know what more to say. Like how could we explore that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: Would you feel differently with Nelson? (sp?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, and that\u2019s just because there\u2019s no baggage there. And I\u2019ve deliberately thought of him as, hey, that\u2019s sexy (chuckling). It\u2019s my construction. Not to say that other women won\u2019t find him sexy, but I feel like I\u2019ve also done this subconscious work (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">(pause) But everything else is just, like (pause), I don\u2019t know, so (laughing) weird. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">(pause) Like he\u2019s standard issue in so many ways, Nelson. He has a TV and a couch. We sit on the couch and watch TV. Something that I\u2019ve never actually done with anyone else (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: What do you guys watch?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Whatever. He\u2019s like a Netflix addict, and he\u2019s got this weird taste in movies that I just don\u2019t get. We watch obscure\u2014not that obscure\u2014more standard things. And to be, that\u2019s obscure. Less obscure as in less normal things. Because I feel like he doesn\u2019t have that sort of background that one <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">needs to cultivate genres, and the good directors and all that, because he works so much. Like he doesn\u2019t even know \u201cI Love Lucy.\u201d I\u2019m like, really? How is that possible? You\u2019ve been in the U.S. for so long. Even if you\u2019re not in the U.S., you\u2019re supposed to know \u201cI Love Lucy.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">(pause) But, like, Chris doesn\u2019t have a TV. He never had a TV. One of the many things we have in common that, yeah, we don\u2019t have a TV. But, you know, we watch TV shows together, on his computer. And it doesn\u2019t really face a couch. We\u2019re sitting on two separate chairs, and there\u2019s no cuddling going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">on. There\u2019s no physical connection. But there is, like, a mental couch that we share. In the intellectual\u2014not intellectual, but it\u2019s like a mental couch, in the sense that he and I are thinking the same things. Or we analyze the characters and talk about the plot and all these things, and his history. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200632\">So that feels very much good to do that. Like, a mental warm fuzzy feeling, that I don\u2019t think I get so much with Nelson. But I get the physical warm funny feeling (chuckling), you know what I\u2019m saying? I\u2019m creating another binary, but that\u2019s how I feel. That\u2019s how I can understand the differences (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562670\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">(pause) I\u2019m not saying this only because there\u2019s chemistry between me and Nelson, there are other things. He used to be emotionally supportive, I just guess we haven\u2019t had emotionally supportive things said. Like our fight, we still have to think about it and talk about it. He can\u2019t just apologize, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">and we\u2019ll have sex, and it\u2019s okay, you know? But I feel like, that\u2019s a great way of resolving conflict, you know? I guess I always fantasized about that happening. You know, you fight, and then you have sex, and then everything is back to normal. Like Chris and I just never had that. He\u2019s very passive-aggressive. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200652\">He will go in his head in sulk, and I will hate that. I absolutely hate that. He won\u2019t talk about things, like shove them under the carpet. And then slowly, over days\u2014yeah, that conflict will never go away. So that\u2019s bad, since he never wants to give conflicts any headspace. So in that sense, I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200653\">giving more brownie points to Nelson, in the sense that, at least the guy apologized, and he cries profusely. Cries a lot, and he\u2019s like \u201cwhy can\u2019t you cry?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI just can\u2019t cry in front of you.\u201d I tried, I cried just a little bit. I cry on my own, or I cry in buckets with Chris. But he just cries. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the difference between crying with Chris and Nelson?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I feel protected and safe with Chris. And I also kind of cry because I\u2019m thinking, oh no, and I\u2019m letting him go, or something. I just feel very vulnerable and scared with Chris. Or, I\u2019m able to feel that way about not just him, but about other things. About other things with him. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">Because I guess\u2014(pause), yeah, I guess I\u2019m able to be small with Chris. Really, really small, because I felt small next to him. But with Nelson, I feel like I have to have it all together, or he\u2019ll crush me. Like, I have this thick skin on, or this shield on with him. Because I don\u2019t want to break down, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200692\">you know? And have him walk all over me. But then I feel like, wait, he just did that (chuckling), when he criticized my clothes and everything. So I\u2019m thinking, huh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">(pause) I was crying a little bit, but then I was just, like, I wanted to indulge in it, but I couldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">(pause) Is it important to be able to cry in front of Nelson? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Important for what purpose? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: To fall in a relationship (ph), I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re saying if you want to be with Nelson, that\u2019s really important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t even know if I want to be with him (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: Well, you\u2019re both at a place where you can\u2019t really connect with each other. He\u2019s continuing to go out with his ex-girlfriend, or have some flirtatious experience with her. And you feel attached to Chris, and I don\u2019t hope this for you ultimately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I mean, ultimately you want to be with someone\u2014I mean, I know you\u2019re going through your stuff now, but ultimately you don\u2019t want to be with someone who is flirting with another person. That\u2019s like an ultimate goal. I understand now that things are complicated. You have complicated feelings <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B1\">towards Chris. But you don\u2019t know if Nelson is working on himself the way you\u2019re working on yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: As in? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562670\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Well, in terms of understanding your motivation. You know, you don\u2019t want to be doing this for the rest of your life, I don\u2019t think, in terms of being pulled between two men.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re working on it. Whether he\u2019s working on his issues that lead him to kind of be pulled, I\u2019m not familiar. I just don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah (pause). Yeah, I was asking him, like, what does this mean? I don\u2019t know if I told you, but he said he wants revenge from her, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: What do you mean? No, you didn\u2019t say that. Revenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: From his ex-girlfriend. Because she, quote, screwed him over, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: And how is he getting revenge? I don\u2019t understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. He said, like, by showing her what she can\u2019t have. Like, what? And the standard way of doing that is to take your current girlfriend and show her off. And then he\u2019s like, oh, that\u2019s how amateurs do that. Like, that\u2019s so weird, are you an expert in this field?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">THERAPIST: An expert in revenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, and then he\u2019s like, no, you flirt in a way that makes the other person think, is that flirting or is it not? And I really don\u2019t think she\u2019s that stupid. So I don\u2019t know. Like yeah, I don\u2019t want to get involved in this, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">(pause) Yeah, that sounded, kind of, really scary to me, and like puts me off (ph). I always seek that out. Because he comes to D.C. over the weekend. And every weekend it\u2019s like, okay, I need my release, after a week of working hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">(pause) It\u2019s just become a pattern. It\u2019s been going on for several months now. I mean, this kind of fight, this conversation with Henrik (sp?), he was thinking of telling his parents. You know, it\u2019s, like, ironic. I guess it makes sense. You\u2019re thinking of long term, and commitment and all that. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200951\">all of his fears will crop up. His fears, like, I don\u2019t make money, or I seem to like the fact that I don\u2019t make money. Or I take favors from friends. And then I don\u2019t know what looks good on me, of my clothes (ph). So, it\u2019s like weird things that I never thought people would criticize me before. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">(pause) Yeah, my reasons for moving away from Chris are more like, (chuckling), you know, in the way that (ph), you know, you don\u2019t turn me on anymore. That\u2019s very basic. And you can be judgmental and compare. He\u2019s actually so comparative\u2014I shouldn\u2019t say so comparative, but like, even explaining, we <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200971\">were talking (ph). Yeah, this guy, he\u2019s a year younger to me, but he has tenure. And he\u2019s got this, he\u2019s got that. Well, he doesn\u2019t have two PhDs. He started doing this soon after he graduated. And that\u2019s really tripped me up, you know? Thinking this person\u2019s making that much money, that person\u2019s making <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200972\">that much money. That just really puts me off. Then I just want to go and sit in a room, and not talk to him (chuckling). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: Chris is saying that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Because he feels, at times, inferior? Or what is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">CLIENT: Well, I don\u2019t think he feels inferior. He can never feel inferior. Maybe he can. But, like, he\u2019s ambitious, so I guess he just sees what others have and he doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think he feels jealous. I don\u2019t think he feels inferior. Maybe he\u2019s trying to find a motivation in that? Yeah, I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F1\">that\u2019s accurate. To work even harder. Like, oh, this guy has this many publications out, work. I think that might be his thinking. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562670\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">(pause) Which I guess I also try and do, you know.

Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Because there are some pretty serious problems with each of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah? Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Well, Nelson wants to get revenge on somebody. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a really good sign, right? And Chris\u2014I don\u2019t know what will happen with Chris. There are some things that you really have questioned, in terms of a long-term relationship. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I just think of him, and I think of this moments where I\u2019ve been unhappy with him. And that\u2019s all I think. In the sense that, like, when the question of commitment comes up. Like the trip to Portland, or whatever. It just sits on me, and it\u2019s this burden. Like, no! I don\u2019t want that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Cecelia (sp?), we really need to stop for today, but I\u2019ll see you on Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: Okay, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Take care, bye.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
