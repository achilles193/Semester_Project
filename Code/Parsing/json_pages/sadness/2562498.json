How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m doing okay. (pause) I\u2019m better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Is the microphone on that side?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Yeah.  (long pause)  I\u2019m wondering about why I seem to be taking a different path, having to do with separation from my mom and her mom and her mom, and I wonder why my separation causes so much anxiety at all.  It doesn\u2019t have to, but it does; and I wonder why the different ways of managing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">that aren\u2019t working \u2013 or I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re working. (long pause)  Then what my mom and her mom and her mom have in common is that they\u2019re all pretty intensely religiously devout. (pause) Orthodoxy comes to mind in the older generation and the one after that; and then moving to America sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">broke that, but there was still this very, very strong pull back to that. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that they made their own way when they came. They were very, very flexible, but out of the three it feels like the same level of intensity to me.  (pause) The way my mom describes latching onto it when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">she was five, suggests to me that it made a big impression on her, that it was pretty crucial to her life. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I don\u2019t know what my dad\u2019s ways of dealing with the pains of separations are, but clearly he\u2019s been managing it for a long time. But as soon as he could, my grandfather came to live with them.  I assume they managed their separations since then better than they do now but, at least in my way, they don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">manage it well at all. They just avoid it. It\u2019s hard when he\u2019s a pretty solid caretaker now. He used to be gone for a month a year. I don\u2019t remember what that was like for my dad or my grandfather. But still, that\u2019s not really a separation.  It\u2019s sort of always like he was just going on vacation. My <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">mom\u2019s parenting philosophy on separation has always been very transparent, which is the world will force us to separate and you will figure out a way to deal with it then. She\u2019s always been really confident and clear about that. (both chuckle) Like it\u2019s all my problem or it\u2019s too big and it\u2019s too painful <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">and I don\u2019t want to bother myself with that because my job is to love on you so hard.  That might be a quote. She has stuck to it shamelessly. (pause) I don\u2019t think that was my dad\u2019s natural [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:19), but I think she didn\u2019t care; like she won in that territory. I guess that\u2019s sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200154\">of what happened to her. (pause) It\u2019s not so much like love on you so hard, it\u2019s like keep you very, very close. Those are different. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s a parallel with how it feels with me where I\u2019ll keep very close while you\u2019re here, but then, once we separate, you\u2019re on your own.  CLIENT: Like it\u2019s up to me? Yeah, that\u2019s exactly how it feels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I think it also feels like there is a kind of tacit message from me, if that\u2019s the case, and that if I am not more in touch when you\u2019re not here it\u2019s because that\u2019s what I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I wonder why. I mean, I guess I kind of know why, but I wonder if there really has been cues like that or if . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Like if I actually have a similar philosophy or similar story I\u2019m sticking to?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562498\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, you kind of do. The story isn\u2019t similar, but the fact that you\u2019re sticking to something. That feels the same. Neither person\u2019s story sticks well usually. (pause)  What I think about my mom these days is like okay, well the world did it and here I am. I\u2019m dealing with it myself. See <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">you when I\u2019m done. It kind of feels like that, like she\u2019s not really involved, and what she does have to offer feels outdated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s kind of similar and something that\u2019s quite different, but I think you feel similar that she and I are this way with you. The thing that is similar is maybe it is true that, in general \u2013 not always, but in general \u2013 when you\u2019re not here, I\u2019m not there to help you with the separation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\"> I think the thing that feels true to you or you act like it\u2019s true but isn\u2019t is that when you\u2019re here, I\u2019m not here to help you with the separation, which I think is part of what she says or what she means. She\u2019s not just saying the world is going to separate us and you\u2019ll have to deal with it when <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">I\u2019m not around. You\u2019ll have to deal with it \u2013 period \u2013 like she all that either to talk about it when you\u2019re with her.  And you, I think, often have acted that way with me, as though that\u2019s not a subject for in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Except to kind of refer to it going on \u2013 not always, but I think often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s really hard to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think this is the only reason, but I don\u2019t think that sort of in a conscious way you would say \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: I do sometimes feel like you have no clue what I\u2019m talking about, with respect to all of the intricacies and nuances of how painful the separation is.  Like you could never know because that\u2019s probably not your issue. Do you know what I mean? In the issues you struggle with, that\u2019s probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">not one of them. But I have no idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Right, that\u2019s your idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Sometimes that\u2019s a strong deterrent for me. (pause) I guess I haven\u2019t ever felt understood in that way, except that I see it in people.  I see it in my mom, so I know that she must understand from direct experience, but I\u2019ve never felt like somebody had connected with me over it. (pause) Yet. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">(pause) I have to use words here.  [A lot gets] (ph?) left out when trying to bring the separation there. It\u2019s getting easier, like two different languages, because the separation is a silent thing. Not like full of words, but when I\u2019m experiencing the pain I\u2019m full of words about it. (pause)  Well . . . (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: There have been times, I think a bunch of them, where you have felt like I\u2019ve got something or spoken to something about separation and difference. There are language and metaphors that go along with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah.  (pause) It feels in progress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t doubt that at all and I don\u2019t doubt your experience of feeling like you have not been understood in it. I guess what I am wondering about is \u2013 and I also think that that feels very isolating \u2013 whether you\u2019re kind of keeping me at a distance there.  It\u2019s not that I think I do wholly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">understand, but that you\u2019re like \u201cJay, he doesn\u2019t know really. Not really. Maybe there\u2019s a lot that you really don\u2019t understand. \u201c That partly hurts a lot to talk about and [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:40).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562498\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Why? Is that like it wouldn\u2019t hurt so much because I wouldn\u2019t be talking about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, there is something about the silence. (pause) There, too, the pain is too bad and the silences are too scary to have them meet a lot.  Yesterday wasn\u2019t that satisfying initially to tell you about what happened on Monday. I told you and it felt like it didn\u2019t go anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I had a similar sense and I don\u2019t know what actually brought it out, but something was amiss. In other words, I\u2019m not saying that you didn\u2019t say something because I misunderstood, I don\u2019t get it, but there was some way the [suffering] (ph?) didn\u2019t happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: In that you were silent for a while?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Maybe that was the problem. I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: I felt like I couldn\u2019t really get into it and I could have gotten into it when I called you on Monday, and that felt like a missed opportunity; so that was kind of still on my mind.  Like okay, here is a second-rate explanation. You could have gotten the first-rate explanation, but it didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">work out and . . . Yeah, like there is too much space to dip more than my toe in. Thinking back, that may be how it felt. (pause) But it didn\u2019t feel like you missed. You referred to it later and it didn\u2019t feel like you missed the point. It felt like you got it, in some ways. Yeah, that\u2019s a good example <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">of why I\u2019m not super eager to try again.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: I guess you were feeling of talking about it was that you were still pretty much on your own with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s unclear why. It had something to do with my not saying more, although, as you say, it didn\u2019t seem like I didn\u2019t get what you were talking about, in some way. And yet, still somehow there was something missing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, like I needed help [to bring] (ph?) whatever was missing. It felt like you heard something different from what you were getting, too \u2013 or than what I had. Sometimes when I read other people\u2019s words about anything or when you offer words in a more symbolic way about something that feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">unreachable by words to me, that can help shift or reorient myself to address a fuller part of an experience.  (pause) I still feel like the me that was crying on the bench in the cold is still there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it seems like there is some way that neither of us is quite in that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes, she is still there, waiting.  (long pause)  Maybe I wasn\u2019t really in it when it happened. Why didn\u2019t I leave a message for you? It sort of felt like I was half in, half out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: We just have a few minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Or like I really didn\u2019t want you to be a part of it, but I kind of did. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: It seems like it was Monday when you were talking about the dream and the hug.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: No.  Monday was when . . . I was trying to think yesterday about what happened on Monday, too. I know there was one where I was [sitting over there for a second] (ph?) and there was some argument. Oh \u2013 because I e-mailed you on Friday asking for more time; and it felt like we were arguing about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">whether it was there. I think it was unconsciously there on Friday morning. And it felt like you were missing the point of how painful it was and then it felt like you weren\u2019t missing it anymore.  The hug, I think, and the dream, I talked about the Thursday before that.
