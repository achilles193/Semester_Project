Come on in. (pause) Good morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Morning. It's early. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: So the last two days at work were miserable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I've been dealing with something that's not really my fault, but in my job I work closely with out education consultant who is not in the office. He work remotely and he made this spreadsheet that I use on a monthly basis. I basically enter in numbers based on my billings and numbers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">And so my boss, Harrison, who is the owner, you know, needs to use this spreadsheet for a purpose that's not it's original intent. And he was upset that the numbers didn't really show what he wanted to see. And, you know, the past two days we've basically been reinventing the wheel. And, you know, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">get this sense that even though I try to make it clear that I'm not the author of this spreadsheet, he feels and has sort of been, you know, taking out his frustration on me a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: As we've been going through this. Luckily we finished it all yesterday afternoon, but it's a little frustrating and discouraging when, you know, it's like not my spreadsheet. I'm just entering the numbers that I have. And, you know, Barry, who is our education consultant, he pretty much checks <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">my work each month. So, you know. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Hm. So you're blamed for something that is not something that you did wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: That's what it feels like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Mm. Kind of like the messenger is being shot?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Pretty much. Yeah. I mean, he did point out, Harrison, when we were working on it together Monday that, you know, I'm probably going to spend quite a few hours making changes to this spreadsheet to the changes that, you know, Harrison wants. But when we send it to Barry he's obviously going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">to have a different opinion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">And so I think he sort of realizes that there's a bit of a disconnect and, you know, too many people working on this. But I still feel like I'm the one getting the blame for it. (sigh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause) Do you feel like in that position often?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Um. I wouldn't say often. You know, it comes up at least a couple of times a month. A lot of the problems, especially in the office, is that Harrison, he's not so much a delegator as he is a micromanager. And he likes to do a lot of things himself but not include people in the loop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">And that's how one of the problems with this situation came in, because he has discussions with our consultants and agrees upon fees with them. But, of course we, you know, as in education we all mark up the fee and that's what we show the client. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">But, you know, he never tells anybody what that original fee was with the consultant. And so usually situations like that where he didn't share information and it's like he expects me to know something that I wouldn't know. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: I try to point out as much as possible though, \"Harrison, you didn't tell me that.\" And I'd say more times than not he realizes if he hadn't told me something, yeah, it shouldn't be my fault. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Mm. Being blamed for something of which you're not the author is a very eloquent way of putting it. I liked how you put it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559562\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. (laughs) (pause) So that's been the past two days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: He's [out up at a cite] (ph) this morning so I'll actually be able to catch up on stuff that got pushed to the back burner the past couple of days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Which will be nice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause) I was also thinking the micromanagement part, isn't that kind of a carryover from last week. It certainly a style you're intimately familiar with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs) Yeah. (pause) My previous manager was like that too in my old office. When I worked under that manager he was the same way too, micromanaged a lot. And sometimes I just had to take my own initiative and do something which in the end always upset him. But, yeah, it had to get done. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">(laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause) What are you thinking about? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Work. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Um. You know it's interesting because I left my other job because, you know, it was getting very unpleasant working with the person I was working with. And this job I really enjoy a lot of what I'm doing, but it's really tough to work with Harrison at times. And it's a small ten person office <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">and everybody seems to agree that he can just be so difficult at times to work with. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">He hardly makes time for things that need to be done because he needs to be involved in everything. So there's a lot of, you know, scheduling and rescheduling. I usually, for example, Patriots Day, I took the day off as I normally do. In my old office we were closed, but we're open here so I took the day off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">And he knew I was planning to take the day off. He said I could and, you know, I had invoices ready way in advance for the two of us to review so I could get them out the door. And he knew that and I kept telling him, \"Whenever you're ready.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">And I came in on Tuesday morning after Patriots Day and, you know, the first thing he says to me is that he's worried about invoices. We really need to get them out the door. It's like, \"Well, I've been telling you that for the past week and a half.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: So do you feel he doesn't listen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: I wouldn't say he doesn't listen so much as he doesn't process what you're saying to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: But I have to repeat things to him quite often. And, you know, there are things that I have said to him in the past, you know, asked him about in the past, mentioned to him in the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">And, you know, he's acknowledged and had some sort of response to, but then later on he, you know, that same day or that same week or something, he'll ask about it again as if we never had that previous discussion. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm. There's something he's not taking in. How long have you been working there for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: It would be a year at the end of June.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: One of my plans is once I finish my degree this month -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Oh, you finish at the end of the month?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Oh wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Right. I'll have my MA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Whatever that means. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Why do you mean? It means you have a MA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: It means I have a -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Does it mean something other than that? (inaudible at 00:13:34)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: (laughs) [I don't know.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: That was an interesting way of putting it, \"Whatever that means.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559562\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Well, you know, I've been reading a lot of stuff recently about, you know, \"Do you really need an MA?\" You know, \"How it helps you or it doesn't.\" You know, looking back I kind of wonder how much I've learned in the program versus how much I've learned actually in the field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: You know, I feel like in the end it's just going to be a title type thing. And, you know, because most of what I've learned has been in the field. But my plan is to start my job hunt again over the summer and maybe find something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause) Did you do it sort of part time in the evening, the degree?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: It was an online degree with University of Southern Mississippi. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Very intensive. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: I sort of like the challenge of the program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. What about it in particular?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Specifically, I always, I pride myself on my ability to juggle a lot and prioritize and time management. And that's one thing I liked about it is, you know, it dumped a whole bunch of stuff on my plate and, you know, the specific deadlines that I had to meet each week. I like the challenge of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">getting everything done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Hm. (pause) So you can manage a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's another reason I like what I'm doing at work, because I basically, so to speak, I make the office tick. I'm the only non-designer in the office. So I'm handling all of our billings and our invoices coming in and going out, our HR type stuff and the general office management. I enjoy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">having a full plate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: I had a mixed weekend. I went out with A bunch of people were getting together in our local furry group, and so I decided to go to it. They hold this luncheon, it's actually right around the corner (laughs) from the condo and so I actually went to it. And it was interesting because there were <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200971\">only seven of us. And I didn't really feel a connect. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">It's a problem I've had going out with some of these people in the past is I feel it's hard to connect with some of them. And I was kind of glad when I left. (laughs) You know, it was nice to go out with people but (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: What feels missing in that connection?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: You know, I'm not one hundred percent sure. I was trying to figure that out myself. I mean (clears throat), they're all people that have same, similar interests. I just found it hard to really, you know, connect and I was more like a silent observer for most of the meet up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Hm. What did you observe? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: People chatting, looking at videos. Like somebody, the topic of old cartoons from, you know, I think like the nineties came up. So somebody brought up on their phone a couple of videos. I observed people having a generally good time together. And, you know, I wouldn't say that I didn't have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">a good time, but I just wasn't as active a part to the situation as I would have liked to have been. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause) What would that have looked like? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: I'm not entirely sure because in other situations I have noticed myself in similar positions, like a silent observer. (laughs) You know, one thing that usually makes that different is, I guess part of it is having something that almost forces me to be more active. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559562\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">You know, we had gotten together with some people to play board games a couple of months back. And, you know, at first we were just sitting around in the living room talking, I was really the silent observer. But then when we actually gathered around the table and started playing some games I was a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">bit more active in the conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">Something about just not having something that ties everything together in the center. I don't know if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause) And so when you said mixed, it was mixed because of that experience? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: No there was some good things in the weekend too. I got together with a friend on Saturday and I had a good time. (pause) You know we tried something I've never You know, new experiences and we actually did some weird, I wouldn't say weird Um. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">We (pause) did this fun little role play thing and it was actually really fun because I got myself into this headspace that I just hadn't been in before and really, I was really happy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: I wasn't thinking about anything else outside of the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: And that was fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: What was the role play about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: (laughs) (pause) Um. (laughs) Uh. (pause) See -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Was that too direct of a question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: (laughs) No, no, no. Um. I just have to remember, you've heard it all. (laughs) Or very close to that I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess it's probably literally impossible to hear it all, but I've heard certainly quite a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: Um. I guess it's what you could call almost like, I guess Maybe, yeah, that is the right term. What they would call \"Pet Play\" I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: And so that was basically it. I was playing the role of a pet almost. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: It was fun. I mean, you know, just almost like escaping for a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Mm. What kind of pet? Were you a particular kind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: (clears throat) A pup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: And it was a good time. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: You know, it was something I've never done before. I was very (sigh) nervous and anxious, but I was like, \"Hey,\" you know, \"let's try it.\" And I'm glad I tried it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: What did it feel like to be in that, to be a pup and be in that headspace?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: It felt (pause) It felt good. It felt fun. You know, I can't really think of anything, any specific, anything more specific than that. You know, I sort of forgot about everything going on in my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Hm. What did you do as a pup? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: Just, you know, played around. You know? My friend has this big like yoga ball that we played with. And, you know (pause) It was all very innocent and fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause) (sound of phone vibrating)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: I thought I had turned that off. But yes, very innocent and fun. But I felt good for the rest of the day. And when I woke up Sunday morning I sort of, I wouldn't say crashed, but (pause) I definitely came down from that high. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: Which is why I was really looking forward to going to that meet up on Sunday. That was sort of a letdown, but (pause) I definitely plan to hang out with this friend again and do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Who was he?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559562\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: Um. Just another furry friend that lives in the area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Yeah. I guess my question wasn't specific enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: In the role play who was he?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: Well like just (pause) I guess caretaker or something, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Not another pup though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: No. (sound of phone vibrating) Do you want me to turn that off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: It's up to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: It stopped. I don't know. (laughs) But, yeah, pretty much a caretaker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Did he take good care of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">THERAPIST: Hm. That sounds nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was definitely a lot of fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">THERAPIST: So what was the crash on Sunday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">CLIENT: I had a very slow morning. You know? I slept in until eight, which is very rare for me. I'm usually up and out of bed around six-thirty. And, you know, I'm not sure if that's just because I was tired or what. But I just had a very slow start to the day. Yeah. I had had so much fun Saturday that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B1\">you know I woke up Sunday and it's like back in reality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">CLIENT: And, you know, it sort of, I could say I hit that brick wall of reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">CLIENT: Sunday morning. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">THERAPIST: Was there a particular reality that hit you or that you hit maybe?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: I would say the main thing is the reminder that I am once again alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I almost felt like this weekend was two steps forward one step back, mentally and emotionally. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">CLIENT: I'd say I felt (clears throat) better Sunday night than I did Sunday morning. Especially once I started, now I started getting myself into things I had to get done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause) Do you think about Liam?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">CLIENT: A lot. (pause) You know, we still chat online a couple of times a week. I have friends coming in this weekend for a graduation. And, you know, they had purchased tickets for a lunch cruise up on the harbor on Sunday that they wanted to do. And, you know, they had gotten four tickets and, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201271\">know, I asked him if he still wanted to come and, you know, he's coming down for that. So that's nice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">CLIENT: They really like him so they would love to spend some time with him. And I think it will be good for us to continue nurturing this friendship. But I do still think about him a lot and, you know, wonder, \"What's he doing? What's he up to?\" You know? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">He sent me a message (laughs) Friday night after I got home from dinner with some friends. He had sent me a message complaining about how much his father talks and he had forgotten how much his father talks. And, you know, so we (inaudible at 00:35:57).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">I'd like to say I'm making the transition pretty well into friendship, but there's still quite a few moments when I have to remind myself, you know, things have changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">CLIENT: It's not like that now. (pause) And I think that's the one thing that hit Sunday morning is, you know, waking up and realizing that a lot has changed over the last couple of weeks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause) When you do think about that, how do you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">CLIENT: I feel sort of responsible for the change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">CLIENT: I guess one feeling that's been strong throughout the entire process is I almost feel like there's something wrong that I can't control and I'm somehow being punished for it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2013A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559562\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah that's been strong for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">CLIENT: The feeling of being punished for something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Are there other thoughts that go along with that? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">CLIENT: Nothing I can really think of. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">THERAPIST: Where did your mind go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">CLIENT: Just thinking about those moments and trying to think about what else is, you know, what other emotions are present there, feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">CLIENT: Specifically, yeah, just thinking about those moments where, you know, I feel like there's that punishment or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">THERAPIST: Mm. It seems like a stronger version of what you were talking about at the beginning of the session. A feeling that you're being blamed for things about which you're not the author. Punished has a little bit more of a stronger edge to it, but the same kind of idea. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">THERAPIST: Do you think they are related? I mean is it the same kind of feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">CLIENT: I would say there's a distant connection. I mean, yeah, punish is a much stronger feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">CLIENT: I mean, being blamed is like you know, \"You're responsible for this even though you're not the person who created it. But, you know, I hear that you're not the person that created this but you're responsible anyway. This is something you need to fix.\" You're somehow at fault. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">You know, punished it's that action. It's, you know, having something taken away. And it's that feeling that I recognize where things went wrong between us. And I just (pause) Some of it was my own actions that I feel there are things that I need to try and learn how to work on. But I feel like, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D1\">know, there's something, like I said, that's just there's something wrong somewhere that I'm just being punished for that's out of my control. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Mm. Is that a feeling I'm sorry go on -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">CLIENT: I just sort of like, going back to last week almost, the whole volleyball thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">CLIENT: And, you know, it's a similar feeling that I felt then. You know, it's not my fault that I can't see the ball coming at me, but I still, you know, I'm out there and I am open to this public, I wouldn't say public humiliation, but public -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20167\">I guess that's the closest word I can think of right now. But it's not my fault. You know, it's not my fault I don't see the ball coming but yet I still have to be out there doing this and <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20169\">THERAPIST: I was actually I don't mean to interrupt, but we're going to need to stop in a moment. But I was thinking about that as you were describing this feeling of being put in a position that can harm you but that you can't do anything about. And somehow maybe you're being blamed for this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B\">Somehow you're supposed to do something about something for which you have no control over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D\">I mean that seems like a really important feeling for us to sort of continue to think about and understand together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016F\">So I will see you next week then at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20171\">CLIENT: Okay. Sounds good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20175\">CLIENT: (sigh) Off to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">THERAPIST: I know.
