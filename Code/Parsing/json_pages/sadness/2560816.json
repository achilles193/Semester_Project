[laughs] I'm thinking about a lot of things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">It's strange when the seasons change. It's like it forces you to think about it. [laughs] Usually, you don't really notice. At least, when I came back from Nepal, it was like, \"Oh, it's hot here, as well, and sunny.\" Now that leaves are falling and, I don't know, the-it's really cold in the mornings. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">It's like it makes me pause and think about where I am. [laughs] It's different and I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">I guess I've been contemplative lately. I started staying at my place, also, a little bit more-well, just on the weekends [laughs] for now.  It feels different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">I feel like it will be beneficially for me, I think it'll make me stronger. Of course, the money worry is there, but then having your own time and really making yourself use it wisely. [sighs] Feeding yourself and [laughs] all of that. Doing it all by yourself is very different from doing it along with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">someone else. For me, it's...not new, but newish. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">Going to places, socializing, and then coming back to an empty place or an empty room [laughs] and then working, it's a very different rhythm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">I went to two very different events on Saturday. I was just thinking about my reaction to both of them. I think one was a birthday party for a little girl. She was turning one; she's a friend's daughter. The other was a launch of a news website that my professor asked me to go to, very different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">I was so anxious at the birthday thing.  It's just like it's so-it's like I'm thinking, \"You know, it's not just my scene,\" but then I know I really want to have a child sometime soon. I'm no good in wholesome family scenarios at all. [laughs] The night (ph) party with loud music and guys asking me <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">out is my scene, apparently. I just feel like I'm in my element, even though I knew no one there. I got there too late and my professor had already gone. Still, it didn't depress me as much the first event. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">I was just still judgmental. I got there and I was like, \"Oh my gosh, this is like somebody just went onto the website and picked up ideas about colors about themes (ph) and colors.  It's so gaudy or whatever; this is not my taste.\" [laughs] It was happy and I love the child, of course. I sat there <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">and played with her, but I was-that didn't mean that I wasn't judgmental about how the party looked and what they did. [sighs] I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">There's this one girl there, she was-she looked like maybe she's in her 20s or something. She was just eating and just standing there and I guess stood there awkwardly for a bit and then we started talking. She asked me what I did.  It bugs me so much when people ask me that question, especially these <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">people. People like her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">(inaudible at 00:09:14) I was like, \"Yeah, I'm an artist,\" and [told her] (ph), she's like, \"Uh huh.\" She was just stuffing her face. She's like, \"How do you know this person?\" I was like, \"Okay, like this.\" Then she's like, \"Yeah, well, that's my brother over there and that's his wife. That's their <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">two-month-old child. I'm a research analyst at Yale.\" All the while, she's stuffing her face with pudding. I just felt so awkward and strange. She's so tiny.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560816\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">I was just so upset. I was like, \"How can someone like that make me feel so insecure?\" I want to jump off the... [laughs] out of the window or something.  I just felt really frightened. I'm just like, \"Why did I feel that way?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">I was telling Chris then we had-we were talking about the fact that I just see things like that. She just felt so bastioned (ph), like, \"That's my brother. That's my family. I have a nice job. I have no worries. I'm stuffing my face with the pudding.\" I was stuffing my face, too. [laughs] My eating <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">seemed like a disorder [laughs] compared to her eating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Well, I don't know. She was thin. I don't know, I just-I have this weird thinking that if I'm eating, it's wrong, but if someone else is eating, it's nourishing and it's right, it's wholesome and it's healthy. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">I don't know, it's like-[grr], I can still feel that whatever I was feeling at that moment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">The whole time, I'm just like, \"I just want to run out of there.\" People with their babies; yeah, just family people and felt smug. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">I went with my mom. I went with a few friends, also another family and my mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">I guess I didn't go with a partner. I didn't go with Chris, so maybe I felt more alone. [The thing] (ph) is just the loneliness is inside me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: I think that's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: [laughs] I still feel like-that's what I feel. I just go into these places and I feel like everyone is just out there to attack me. Even simple questions like, \"How do you know this person?\" about the mother just felt like an attack. It's like, \"What the hell are you doing here?\" That's what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">it felt like. [laughs] It's just so weird; it obviously didn't mean that at all. To me, it's like, \"What right do you have to be here? What makes you valid?\" It's totally my own interpretation. The whole time, I was just in defense mode and people are attacking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">Then at the other place, no one knew me, and that was a bit scary. People were drunk and dancing and they knew the...the value of doing something different. You're (ph) a journalist...so they know that they're doing something that's writing (ph). It's difficult and it has its own anxieties and very <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">small rewards. [laughs] I felt like everyone was a little island, maybe because everyone was American there. At my gathering, most everyone was Nepalese. I don't know about that thing (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">I guess I felt like I'm okay at a place where people somehow...have already (ph) a value system that they'll bring to me, to what I'm doing.  If they don't have a good value system with judging, then I just feel totally insecure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: How do you know what their value system is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Well, they don't share it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Right, so how do you know what it is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: No, it pisses me off that they wouldn't want to share it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: What are they sharing?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560816\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Nothing, which is what I don't like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: What would you want them to share? I don't think I'm following that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Well, when I say, \"I'm doing this,\" are you just going to keep eating your pudding? You're not going to say anything, like, \"Oh, that's brave (ph). Oh, that's interesting. Oh, that's different. Oh, okay, I have no opinion.\" Something, some reaction.  Are you just senseless right now? You're <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">just drowning [laughs] your senses in pudding so you can't really process. I don't know, maybe it's-yeah, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: It's the lack of response?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: I don't know what. I was just pissed. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Maybe lack of response. Just the smugness got to me. That makes me very hateful and judgmental. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: You felt she was sort of communicating to you that she was better than you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Well, she had everything and I was stupid (ph) one.  I'm sure that that's not what they meant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">I don't need people-I don't mind people being better than me. I just mind that they have no opinion of me. They're apathetic or don't value me. I can be on a lower rung, that's fine, but I would like to be on a run instead of just being outside or floating away or something. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: It's your perception that you're on a lower rung.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Not really. You just said, \"Is she better than you?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: I'm just saying that's fine, she can be. Obviously, she is.  She's working at Yale, so obviously she's making much more money. [laughs] Right now, everyone is making more money. That's fine. It's okay. I can't really do anything about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">At least you can say, \"Hey, that's interesting,\" or, \"Tell me more,\" or something. [laughs] I feel silly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Why? What do you mean, right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. I sound like a baby complaining. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: I (inaudible at 00:17:49) feel like I'm in my early 20s again. [laughs] That when my mom would be like, \"Let's go do this,\" \"Let's go to that,\" and (inaudible at 00:17:58) often would be community gatherings such as this.  I'd be all snobby like Chris, like, \"I'm not going to that shit.\" [laughs] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">\"It's going to be full of settled people\" [laughs] \"who may be in their 20s or 30s but they certainly look like they're in their late 40s,\" with their prams and strollers and giant diaper bags. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like on the one hand you want that, on the other hand...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: ...you look down on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: I guess I wonder whether you look down at it (ph) because it's something that you want and you feel like you can't have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: I've never heard you express wanting a baby soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I've just been suppressing it because it's really not going to pan out right now [laughs] because I want to finish my book first.  Then obviously, the guy situation [laughs] is clearly very, very messed up [laughs] right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">Yeah, it's there. I take pictures of random kids on the street. [laughs] I'm trying not to think about it too much. I'm trying to tell myself, \"They poop and they make a mess.\" [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">I guess coming back from Nepal, I thought I could do that, bring up a child [with Chris] (ph). Stay at home and do something at home, like writing or part-time teaching or something. [sighs] Not be a full-fledged career person for a few years, at least.  I came back and then all these other problems started.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560816\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">I guess I was just thinking about, from our earlier conversation, the feeling like an outside all the time. Even when people want me, I feel like I need to have-I need to feel like an outsider, still. I end up feeling like jelly or something. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: I try. It's not like I don't try. I try to smile. I try to get over my anxieties and hatred and judgment and go and talk to some people [if not everyone] (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">This is what happens. [laughs] I talk and they say something I hear all this crazy stuff. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">I don't know if there is a chore (ph) or if I can learn something, like people's lack of opinion or taste will always be there and I just have to learn to live with it. Everyone must deal with it. I guess I should ask my teachers how they deal with it, they go around talking to people and they haven't <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">read whatever.

The guy that I'm sort of seeing, he's like, \"Oh, yeah, I liked 'Great Expectations.'\" I'm like, \"Ah, yeah. Dickens is very good.\" He's like, \"Oh!

People in the arts are always how...everyone nowadays is less-reads less books. I think that's a general thing. I guess that, as a psychologist, your question is more pertinent to my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">Yeah, it helps.  Again, that my agenda of feeling valued would happen if they knew that I knew certain things yeah, I don't have a brother standing right there and his wife and his two-month-old, whatever. I don't have that, but I've read books.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Sounds like a competition of value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Isn't every interaction a competition of value?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: No (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: No?

[laughs] Maybe, maybe not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">It's already established. You know who you are, I know who you are. I don't know who I am and we're trying to figure that out. It's not really a fair competition.

[laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess the point I'm making is that you're bringing a set of your own assumptions to these interactions in (ph) assuming that other people are thinking these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: You have no idea what they're thinking.

Why didn't I have that when it was the right time, in my childhood? Why didn't I have...? I had a dad, why wasn't he there? Why wasn't my mom into (ph) me?

I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Well, it could be cooking together, meaning you and Chris? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">CLIENT: No, his friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Chris's friends?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. People he was staying with in Cambridge. [sighs] I was invited, but I didn't go. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">THERAPIST: You experience Chris as very judgmental.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">THERAPIST: I know there are parts of him that you feel are nurturing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">THERAPIST: ...and he takes care of you, so I know that's not the whole picture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:42:37)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">Again, it feels like (inaudible at 00:42:46).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">I guess all this must have something to do with how I categorize people, because anyone can be cold and warm, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Some people are more cold and some people are more warm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Some people can be very embracing and accepting; some people judgmental. People can be a composite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">THERAPIST: It depends on the person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">THERAPIST: You're feeling differently and you're curious about that, a change of seasons and growing pains and what this means for you and the implications and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess the goal's really that you bring out the side of people that makes you feel good and makes them feel good.  Have a productive interaction, because everyone can be cold and warm some more, some less, obviously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">Hopefully I'm not in that phase anymore, where I inspire judgment and negative behavior like I did with those guys. That's what I'm hoping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Well, they inspired it in you, too. It was a two-way street.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was very-they were cold and I was whatever, needy or something (ph) [laughs] whatever. [I don't know] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">THERAPIST: They were like an empty refrigerator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">CLIENT: [laughs] Yeah? I would say they were more like rabid dogs, barking at me. [laughs] Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">THERAPIST: That's different than refrigerator, for sure-an empty refrigerator (crosstalk at 00:45:01).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560816\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">CLIENT: An (ph) empty refrigerator's just standing there. These guys were bitchy. They bitched. Victor threw me out of his house. That other guy was just like, \"Wah, wah, wah, wah,\" and judgment all the freaking time. [laughs] They weren't just standing there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop for today. I will see you on Wednesday!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">CLIENT: Okay. It's 9:50?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, exactly. Okay, take care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">CLIENT: You, too.
