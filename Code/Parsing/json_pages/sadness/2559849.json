Something's [inaudible] all about your manner or tone and (pause) I wouldn't always think that about your being quiet as you are, but today I it's part of how it seems to me. [00:10:57.05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I'm not sure. (pause) I'm confused about what to do. (pause) Last night I had a very raw, heavy, heavy heart and felt it so directly and without much resistance. And it was so painful but I my heart isn't that way at this moment. And {inaudible] I should talk to you then. [00:12:08.25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I come from a weekly [inaudible] talk. And I didn't really want to go to the talk, but I just wanted to be at the center [ph] and be in that have the spirit of that sort of thing come over me. (pause) And the talk was about forgiveness, which at the beginning I didn't feel like I had any strong <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">relationship or feelings about forgiveness in my life. But I had a lot of thoughts about Jeremy and forgiving himself. And that was my angle. But it became really, really clear that (pause) there is a war going on inside me and it doesn't really matter. [00:14:46.13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Is it clear what for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: For experiencing anxiety and for being so naive about it and for experiencing that [inaudible] and for spending so much energy in the last year on all these different things. For not for I'm mad that it hasn't gone away and it meant that it meant both that I haven't figured out how to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">make it go away and I don't mean I guess I mean everything that feels foreign, everything that [inaudible] foreign. I'm mad that the foreign things haven't gone away. [00:17:11.19] And I'm also mad that I haven't accepted them yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: You're still struggling with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Well I'm still struggling I'm resisting them so much. Either of those things seems better than how it is. But what do I gain out of thinking so much about how it's not. (pause) So I haven't forgiven myself for [inaudible] intervention that's here. [ph] [00:19:30.07]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559849\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: My hunch is that some part of this has to do with the difficulty, letting yourself not be in control, letting go with me of your feelings and a fantasy that you ought to be more in control of how you feel or at the very least how and when you express what you're feeling. [00:21:26.01] And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">I'm not sure why. I think it might be at least part of it might be because you're terrified of feeling dependent or of how dependent. You can feel sometimes how much that affects you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: That's a lot of things. [ph] They sound manageable. [00:22:45.24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I think that's something you've been trying to manage with me since before you knew you were trying to manage it with me. And that when it comes up, comes up just like this, leaving you feeling very upset and with a very heavy heart and very raw. And at times when you're not here and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">it's difficult you feel and get at it and see about [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: There's so much else going on here. [00:24:22.03] It's really hard having feelings for you because I mean in one sense it I think it's helping things ripen. But in another sense it gets in the way of a whole bunch of stuff because I'm pretty focused on you when I'm here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: And not that much on myself. I mean I am right now but the whole Jay theater is about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Addison, [ph] that may be partly by design.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: I think so. [00:25:27.07] I think the part of that thing is ripening [ph] is really important. I think it wouldn't work if it weren't like this for me. But if you ask me why is it hard to get with what's happening when I'm here it's because it feels to me like I'm worried about a lot of other <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">stuff. Or I'm preoccupied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: There's all these ways you were so sure it's going to be better to present yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: I can't help it. [00:27:04.13] I don't think that much about whether I should present myself or not. It's like I have to try really hard not or I have to make it an object of, I don't know, concentration or meditation or something to let the fantasies...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: The party dreams, I think, speak to this or sort of highlight this, I think, pretty well. That sense of energy and excitement and a certain sort of connection among people. And a nice one in some ways. But also so that it excludes other things. I'm not saying it's bad. [00:28:16.20] I'm just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">saying I think it captures that kind of exciting probably performative connecting in a certain way, sort of, feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: I got really mad about tissues recently, there being tissues here. [inaudible] I don't mind [ph] tissues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: I don't use tissues. I don't like them. I like using my sleeve and I like using water. So Jeremy says that some people like using tissues. [00:29:26.24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Well, I think it makes you feel like passive and set up that there are tissues here. Or if I'm being more accurate that I set you up and I sort of put you in a passive way in relation to me that you really don't like and find also find [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: I don't know. [00:30:49.02] It feels like it takes a lot of effort to not think to not fantasize about who I should be here. [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: You mean your inclination whether you're here or not is to fantasize [inaudible] about who you should be.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559849\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and not just when I'm here. In for most for a lot of things. I fantasize about what will happen and what will I feel like and what will I say when I walk into our apartment. We talked him and I talked about this recently. [00:31:55.12] I think there's I mean I think it's related <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">to fantasies happen when I'm feeling excited and anxious and scared. And that's something. So it's a way to feel in control or to explore the various possible outcomes so that I'm ready for them or something. But my mind is highly anticipatory. This is how I relate to future events. Even ones that aren't <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B2\">that scary on the surface. But especially ones that are. [00:33:06.17] (pause) Also, I miss you, so I think about you a lot. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I think that [inaudible] have about how you should be here are to do with being a certain way so that it feels like you and I are connecting with a lot of intensity, and that without that it doesn't feel like I'm here with you in the same way. [00:36:06.19] It feels like a missed opportunity. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">And like you're more on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know about that. It feels like a missed opportunity, yeah, but I don't know that fantasizing about being here when I'm not here helps me feel like you're more with me when I'm here. It helps me feel like you're more with me when I'm having when I'm thinking about it when <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">I'm not here. But I don't know how much it changes what I feel like when I'm here. [00:37:06.04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: I guess I had the impression or what I meant was [inaudible] not how it is, that it's a little like gearing up to be on, like if you were playing in a softball game or in a jazz concert or something like that, where you want to feel like you're sort of geared up [inaudible] really there <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">and you're really kind of on. And you sort of hit it. And if it doesn't feel like that happens here it isn't because of you or me or something. I think it feels like we're not as connected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: And then a level of honesty [inaudible] and intensity that (pause) [inaudible] makes [inaudible] makes us feel more connected [inaudible] The problem, I think, is that that's sort of the channel for connecting, and there are other very important channels [inaudible] really, really sad that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">involve connecting in a very different way. [00:39:24.07] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: It feels like it's missing the point a little bit. The point feels like what do I do when I'm with you and what do I do with all of this energy I have for wanting to seduce you. These are states of unrest that [inaudible] and fantasies about what goes on here and what kind of what it could <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">be like and what it will or should or might be like even to provide me some relief for those two things. [00:40:41.04] It also might be a channel for connecting, but I don't think that's the whole story. If I could find relief in some other way I would not spend so much time thinking about how it should <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200772\">be here. (pause) Because I would have more trust or something. (pause) Like this wouldn't be this huge chance to find relief. There would be some other ways to find it and this could be something else. Or some chance to find relief but also I don't know. [00:42:06.13] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: You're right.

I think, actually, my script and plan and fantasies tend <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">to never even the ones that I can make happen, they don't tend to happen because I just they're not important any more when I get here.

[00:49:22.05] I think it is with me, but yeah, you don't tell me about the other parts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: And I don't think it feels like I spend a lot of time with you when you're thinking about some of the things you're telling me you're thinking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I can imagine spending all the time with you, so compared to that this is not this doesn't even [inaudible] grasp. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: I think something else that's [inaudible] is if it is a lot of it is about how I'm loved and maybe also how I want to be, which I imagine, again, in those moments you're feeling very on the outside of. And it's like what could be more about wanting to find a way in than wanting to know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">things like that. [00:52:06.18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I also think a lot about why you do this and why you're here and how often do you really get to see the art. Most of it seems about the craft. (pause) It's really it must be really rewarding but it also maybe it's really isolating too. [00:53:33.27] And I wonder if it isolates <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">you from your family and giving them all of you. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Like being preoccupied?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Or like connected to other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: You have such a I mean this is a practice. This is a practice of a certain way to be with people. And that's not the way that people are for real. [inaudible] love each other except here. So how do those two practices share the same body and mind and soul and [inaudible] words and yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">Also, I imagine if you think that there is do you think there is a way to honor this when it's no longer around? [00:55:33.00] (pause) Are you carrying around all these different art craft hybrids? Or is there a is it lighter. Is there more lightness to it. Like you can honor them without having <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB2\">them follow you around or without having them burdened. And I guess I mean honor not only when it's not when it's no longer around but also when it is around.

[00:58:05.01] I mean what the hell is that, to love someone and not know the kind of things you're talking about. I think it really hardly even makes any sense at all. [00:59:11.27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Except that I trust you.

[01:02:42.26] I guess another way of putting it is you were feeling the weight. I am feeling compassion for you. [inaudible] compassionate Jay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I have this sort of heart rending image of you feeling so much on the outside, like so close on your side and so much on that side from mine.

[01:04:25.04] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I mean I think it's sort of ultimately digestible [ph] and workable but that's not what it is today.

I am also feeling the weight of feeling really, really outside the world, your world, one of the worlds, one of your worlds. I don't think that they're so separate from each other but this is really different from how I am [inaudible] I think it says something about how I love [ph] people. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">I really like to know all about them.

[01:11:03.09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: And I wonder about the world they live in. How can you be a parent when you spend all of your days dealing with what other people's parents didn't do or did do? That's like totally a lot of pressure. But maybe it relieves all the pressure. I don't know. I don't know what a good enough dad looks <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">like. Maybe a good enough dad is the same as a good enough mom but he hasn't been written about as much.

[01:12:38.18] I don't know how much it will help, but me and most therapists I know, I find it [inaudible] easier. I really don't worry so much. I kind of do this or that or do what this book says, that book says or oh my God, if I do this you [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">you do that are part of your personality. You probably couldn't control that much anyway that are going to cause your kid trouble. And the things that you don't know what you're doing to them [inaudible] kind of sort of do your best. [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: I think I have this idealized impression that you are aware of everything, which is false.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: I assure you. [01:14:17.09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: But it seems really hard as a daily meditation practice [inaudible] the way that you behave here, that that much could get by you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: But many people in my life might tell you otherwise. I mean I'm (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: I think a lot about how hard it would be to be married to you. And how easy it would be.

[01:15:32.29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: That's very interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: The second is its general how the public views it and doesn't know what the public doesn't know and what the public does know. I am really stressed about our future because my attitude about it is so unpalatable with him. Not because so my attitude about us and about our future is so unworkable <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF1\">and unpalatable to [inaudible] and that is very stressful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: What...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: I am like pretty much not open to any discussion about anything that involves reducing putting a time thing, kind of boundary on this, or like reducing the number of sessions per week. [01:16:51.21] So that's really hard for him. And he's hurting a lot and it's straining us. I don't think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F31\">my insurance approved me for three more months. [01:17:17.26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: I had sent them another [inaudible] end of March, which they have not gotten so I resent it with a note.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: So that stirred all this up. It's in my mind all the time but for him I think he just prefers not to remember that this is something that I'm completely unreasonable about. Or until a letter comes or I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: I see. Almost like a [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah, so there's that, which is whatever it is, and then there is joining the PPO at the end of the year. And he got so mad that I was talking about something six months from now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: I mean that part does solve the financial problem, assuming the recording continues.

It is tricky. I mean certainly myself and my colleagues [inaudible] and other people I know in the field have done analyses. It is tricky. It can be tricky in a marriage. Sometimes it's more about the money and the times [inaudible] intensity or having this other figure [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201191\">who becomes important. It's a very interesting point about [inaudible] taken care of the partners. I don't recall having seen anything written about a particular [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: He was critical.

And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F1\">am a way about it that is totally unattractive and sort of scary and weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: It's not unlike me. I mean I my mom I talked to my mom briefly about my relationship to boundaries and she's like oh yeah, you have never responded well to boundaries. In fact you do not hear you just can't hear when there are boundaries trying to be placed around you or on you that aren't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201231\">fitting with your vision. She said that I [inaudible] I have a long way to go. She said I don't know why you need to analyze it that much. I always at some point I just said well, this is part of your personality. [01:24:07.02] (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: You have a lot going on in response to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">THERAPIST: Well (pause) yeah, I have a lot of thoughts. (pause) One I mean [inaudible] in a way we were talking a few minutes ago about boundaries and you feeling on the outside as a result of that. And I don't think that's a good thing here. That has I could be wrong but I have the impression that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201291\">something you've felt before probably with your parents. I'm not saying it doesn't also have cause here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">THERAPIST: And I suspect quite painfully, before, as well, at times. And it makes me wonder if that has something to do with your like a piece of your reaction to boundaries that she's referring to. But you're not here because you woke up one morning and decided you wanted to change your personality. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D1\">[01:26:28.20] You're here because you really have struggled with, beginning maybe a year ago, [inaudible] some other times in your life before that, in ways that were painful and difficult [inaudible] separations. There's a lot that still doesn't make sense to any of us, best I can tell, about this <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D2\">for you. I guess [inaudible] stop and we can talk more for a few reasons, the first of which is I'm not starting to get worked up because I don't think it's mostly because I wanted to defend this. I think it's mostly because I wanted to defend you doing what feels right to you and what you want for <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D3\">yourself. However, I really don't know enough I mean that's not what I should be doing. [inaudible] really trying to help you with what's going on [inaudible] defend, which it sounds like it's causing you [inaudible] and a lot of stress.

The point is you're telling me there's <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D5\">this stressful thing happening in your life and I should listen to more about what's going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2012C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559849\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: We should talk about it more.
