This is my thing (laughter) I feel like for over a year it was like wanting to do this but for some reason not doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: What we were talking about on Wednesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah for feeling comfortable enough or I don\u2019t even know, yeah I guess just feeling comfortable enough to dictate that in here or something and kind of wanting you maybe to kind of do that for me or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah that kind of\u2026that ominous kind of feeling that I spoke about so much when I come in here and sit down, like that first sort of step in that direction, get this conversation going. You know what I mean? It sort of is anxious kind of thing in a weird way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Such that I would try to think of things to be prepared for on the train ride here or so on, it just was feeling like there was a lot at stake or something in that moment where I was kind of\u2026I feel like for a while I would take it up with small talk or something because I wasn\u2019t really sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah I don\u2019t know, I guess I just feel a lot more comfortable doing that now, coming in and just saying I want to keep talking about what we were talking about last time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: That seems like a big hurdle for me to kind of get over because I don\u2019t really have that weird feeling like when I would come in here and sit down and you\u2019d just kind of look at me, it\u2019d be up to me to kind of figure out where to go with the conversation, that used to be like a big thing here, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s something that had some sort of like tension for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah I think it begged the question of like what should I do talking about here\/are the things that we\u2019ve been talking about for a while, are those things worth sort of assuming us talking about? Like is it silly for me to even think that\u2019s something worth investigating, like my parents and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">stuff. In different ways I feel like I was kind of playing it out, like when I would ask you so many times \u201cJust tell me if you think this is worthy of my thought or time?\u201d In so many ways I feel like that was something that was really hard for me to just do something so small to like come in here and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F2\">say \u201cI want to keep talking about it.\u201d  You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Yeah, yeah and it seems to\u2026one thought I have is that it has some relevance to me about what you\u2019ve been talking about regarding your dad and your mom and the kind of complications of\u2026not only sharing your experience with them in a unfettered or unfiltered kind of way but also having <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">them yourself in some way, you know, and because what I\u2019m thinking about is how much, how important it was the whole, one of the issues is even getting that it\u2019s like between you and your mom, you and your dad, getting into what your experience was both with them and within yourself meant a whole lot. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200412\">It was almost like I thought you were getting that last time really, really well was this kind of sense of a lot of reasons why you didn\u2019t go there, you didn\u2019t go there because of being very kind of aware of what impact, what effect it would have on others.  I was thinking there\u2019s a certain amount that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200413\">maybe your sort of saying in ways that you bring that with you, you did bring that with you here and in some ways it\u2019s eased or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099689\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, definitely I think last time one of the things toward the end\u2026I think we were having a conversation for a while and going on about me just sort of like cracking this topic open and thinking about it and finding myself going some direction and even less than the significance of whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">I may have been thinking at the moment, just like my general sense of discomfort with even trying to make sense of it, trying to put it together or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: To actually even feel anything very clear, you know, anything that really sort of like puts things on people, good things or bad things that really tries to sort of cut through the fog or whatever. I just felt so uncomfortable even assuming that was a task that I could do or something.  It really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">felt more productive for me to just like stay away from it. In a way that\u2019s very similar I think that was very much like what I was experiencing with you for so long. Like how uncomfortable I felt even presuming that I have the knowledge or the reason to even say I want to come in here for six weeks <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">and keep talking about this one topic. It begs the same question as last time, like if I\u2019m sad, what then? What fault? What does that mean for\u2026about the people that are implicated in the thing I\u2019m sad about, about me, about my relationship with them, how does that\u2026what does that look like for me on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200473\">the other end of that moving forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: And I think it\u2019s like the exact same thing really. I think I really didn\u2019t feel even confident with myself, literally just with myself, saying this is something I feel like I should talk about, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.  Absolutely. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: It feels kind of big I think, even just that, even saying that it\u2019s a thing. I don\u2019t even know what it is. I don\u2019t know within the topic of my parents, their relationship, the divorce, family or something. I don\u2019t have anything really to say about that apart from the fact that that\u2019s like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">component of my experience. That on some level it\u2019s significant and has had an impact. It\u2019s a thing, even if it\u2019s just in a black box, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Like that\u2019s not something that I had before I came here. I still feel I\u2019m not being more comfortable asserting that outside of here but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah and I think it\u2019s, what I think\u2026I\u2019m kind of hearing from what you\u2019re saying is that it\u2019s not just the content of what you\u2019re talking about but it\u2019s the actual process of trying to make sense of it that\u2019s important and relevant too. Your ability to come in and to say \u201cThis is where I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">to start. I want to start by saying I want to think about what we talked about last time,\u201d and having some latitude within yourself to do that, just the process of that and then it is significant in and of itself as well as getting into the feelings that are there.

Before I came here and even as I was working it out I never would have really thought of it in those terms, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">like in a way what I just kind of explained in that I feel like I achieved prior to that and as it was playing out I never would have been able to conceive of that as something that I needed to...you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: But it makes me think like then what\u2019s the converse of that right? Like what\u2019s the (pause), what is the meaning of the lack of that (pause) outside of here?  It clearly, me achieving that is sort of constructing something in here that doesn\u2019t exist and hadn\u2019t existed prior to\u2026what is that inform me about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Those dynamics that didn\u2019t allow that to achieve itself prior to coming here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Which I guess is kind of simple. I guess that speaks to a lot of what we\u2019ve been talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Important. It\u2019s important, it\u2019s very important; I think that a lot of the guts of what you\u2019ve been talking about is in that question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s something important about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Last week we were talking about (pause), I guess that\u2019s kind of what we ended on. I think I kind of felt for most of the session that I was kind of going around in circles a little bit.  I felt like I had lost a little bit of the continuity and momentum I think some of our previous <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">sessions and discussions had but I felt like it was really helpful by the end when I sort of noticed that I felt like what was really happening was me feeling very uncomfortable and I guess maybe me feeling extremely vulnerable would be a better way of putting it. I don\u2019t know. Very vulnerable as I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B2\">try to (pause) assume a sort of positionality (sp?) with respect to this topic that I can maybe, that I wouldn\u2019t just be sort of like doing things to me that I might honestly be able to engage with it and exert some mass really over me. You\u2019ve been like approaching that, imaging that. I just feel very <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B3\">vulnerable and unsure and uncertain about like what comes from that.  About what the means for the image I have of my mother and father, like if those images changed or what it means for me to be able to continue\u2026that means moving forward, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: A lot of what we\u2019ve spoken about in different ways has discussed the fact that this narrative I have in my head, whatever value stems from it doesn\u2019t come from the fact that it\u2019s an accurate representation of anything, you know what I mean, but rather the fact that it seems stead ahead and productive <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">and sort of like a coping sense. It was (pause); I think it was in a way, you know what I mean? I believe that I think partially because when I think about reorganizing that or refiguring that or adjusting some of those components of that narrative I feel a little worried about my ability to cope with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">my relationship with my parents. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099689\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yes.  (pause) How have you felt like, how have you felt about it out there as you\u2019ve been talking about this? How have you felt talking to your mom and your dad? Or thinking about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: I had this conversation with Laney not too long ago, I don\u2019t think I shared this with you but it was after I had gone up to my dad\u2019s with Laney the last time and it wasn\u2019t very enjoyable any more so than it ever is when I go up to my dad\u2019s but it was made particularly anxious for me because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">I had Laney there. I always consider going up to my dad\u2019s for the weekend sort of just as I described it to you, holding your breath and swimming under something until you get to this other side and it\u2019s done and you\u2019ve kind of done it.  It\u2019s not pleasant but you can get through it but when Laney\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200732\">there and those things I sort of like that unease and sort of like sacrifice of myself or whatever I feel goes on when I\u2019m up there, it\u2019s a little more troubling when I feel like Laney comes with me and has to experience that too. It was really sort of tough I think because\u2026having Laney there is a very <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200733\">different experience. I sort of explained it to her because she\u2019s been discussing similar things like with her parents, very basically like she\u2019s developing ideas of how she wants to live her life that conflict with her parents and she\u2019s trying to find ways to navigate that and at the same time deal <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200734\">with the fact that she cares for her parents, doesn\u2019t want to hurt them, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: So on and so forth\u2026I was describing to her I feel like there\u2019s two different ways that I can think about relating with my parents assuming that with my dad for example there are these very different ideas that we have either about things that are just random topics or even about different ideas <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">about each other, like he has a different idea about himself than I do about him or something.  So how do you navigate that? Like when my dad does things and says things it really pissed me off. How do I decide how to react to that? I sort of use this analogy like I feel like you could think of it as <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200772\">me going up to my dad and it\u2019s important for me to sort of vocalize and challenge things that my dad says or has done or whatever and see it as (pause) a sign of weakness or something if I don\u2019t challenge that head on. Like that\u2019s one way that I could think about handling my relationship with my parents. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200773\">Another one would be like the way that you handle going and visiting like an old grandparent who has dementia.

Even if they say things that you would find bothersome you wouldn\u2019t hold them to the same level of accountability and even more so leaving you wouldn\u2019t feel like you had to swallow your <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200775\">pride because you let them say things you knew were wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099689\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Whereas in the former it would be a source of like great discontent and unhappiness or something. Sort of like you leave and you kind of just know that they don\u2019t know any better or something. I sort of explain it to Laney like sometimes I feel like I can take that angle, you know, like the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B1\">grandparent with dementia with my parents or something. With things that are tense and unresolved and bad I can sort of look over them or something. With my dad I think it\u2019s an easier example. I can sort of observe it and just make peace with it and just be like \u201cThat\u2019s you. You don\u2019t know any better, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B2\">it\u2019s not going to change,\u201d the same way I wouldn\u2019t get into a debate with a senile, elderly person, who thinks it\u2019s 1915 because it just wouldn\u2019t be productive, I\u2019m not going to get in that debate with you because it wouldn\u2019t be productive.

That\u2019s something that, that stands in sort of contradiction to my relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">with my dad.

Do you know what I mean? But then I think two weeks ago when I like really recalled the moment of him crying, when he told me about my parents splitting up, it was very evident to me right then that I did not want to bring that back up.  Just thinking about it I wanted to forget <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB2\">it, I don\u2019t want any more of that. That was kind of shocking to me.

Sometimes I imagine that would be cathartic and there would be this new like existence for me or something on the other end of it. That would be revolution or something.

Then it seems to me like pain is a very dubious thing to want anybody to have, anybody to experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like your sort of saying on some register in your mind your feeling the pain, the emotional pain of the divorce for your mom led to a lot of things including bodily\u2026.even in her body it was expressed, there\u2019s this kind of way it\u2019s felt that way to you, like she\u2019s in pain in her joints, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D1\">in her ankles, hands, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: But also like not dating, not resuming a life worth resuming, I don\u2019t know, having a life that wasn\u2019t mired in that pain, wasn\u2019t defined by it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: Mm hm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yeah but the grenade again, the analogy of the grenade, the metaphor of the grenade is like if you get into your own kind of experience, maybe it\u2019s pain but whatever it is if they experience the pain, if your dad does, what\u2019s it going to do to him? Is he going to be a wounded veteran, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201251\">know?  A disabled veteran? Like a dog in this\u2026the way I was thinking about your mom almost like disabled from it.
