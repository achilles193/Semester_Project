I don\u2019t know which guy it refers to, you said things that when you feel power by association.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: inaudible <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I was curious about that, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t feel it, I guess I would deny feeling that, I would be like \u201cOh no, totally not, never\u201d you know? And I was just wondering how do you feel that way or allow yourself to feel that way and what are the limits you know?, because I would be very afraid <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">that I am going to abuse it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: How? How would you abuse it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, like in my childhood there was a little incident. I think I was like 11 or 12 or something and I was just hanging out or 10 maybe. I was hanging out with my friend she was a few years younger, she lived in this large bungalow. This is Nepal. She lived in this large bungalow and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">there (inaudible)  and I was, my parents and I we were renting like a small room in like an annex of another bungalow that was next door to her. And these, a group of people were walking by in the street these are eunuchs (sp?)  their like either castrated men or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Oh, eunuch\u2019s?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yes, hermaphrodites or whatever. Their sexuality is (sp)  their both or neither. So they live in a community by themselves and they earn money by begging, performing dances or singing at functions and stuff. But anyway, so they were walking by and my friend and I were standing, (soft voice \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">what happened) outside the bungalow and, \u201cwhat happened\u201d (again in soft voice), I can\u2019t remember exactly. It\u2019s fuzzy now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what, someone said something from their group, they wanted something and I just had spent an afternoon playing with her, with my friend and they and I said to them, \u201cOh yeah, first you have to if you want this whatever it was they were asking for or saying, if you want this or you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">want to be like us first you have to make, first you have to build a big bungalow like we have. This is totally uncharacteristic of me, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I feel like I\u2019ve always been the sympathetic type who always, now for sure I identify with the underdog, the have not\u2019s, and this and that. But that was like a very uncharacteristic moment and people and I think my friends cousin were also laughing at me and they went and told the adults what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">I said and maybe they laughed at me too. I don\u2019t remember any of them acting surprised. So I think I may have suppressed the rest of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t come from the same economic background as my friend. For some reason I said that, I identified with her as if I also lived in a big bungalow and I was telling off these poor people, like look what I have, I\u2019m so rich and you\u2019re so poor. Something that these rich kids had already done <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">to me by the way, they would be very mean to me. Not my friend, but other kids, actually the kids who I was renting the house from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: That you were renting a house from when you were a kid?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I think I have told you about this girl, we had something sexual going on; when I was 11 or 12.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: And she would make fun of you?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561078\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: No, yea!, with my mom, like she was close to my mom. I think I told you that. But she and her brother would definitely make fun of what little money I had. Yea, they were ruthless, very, very, bad experiences. I was definitely made to feel and know my place. In that group, because you know my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">mom was a teacher and my dad when he was working was a teacher as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: These guys I think they were business men. Their parents were businessmen, and their parents, and they had a big bungalow, and they had a garden with a swing in it and we were just renting out one room. But that was really uncharacteristic of me and I remember I was very ashamed of that morning, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">of telling off of these people who had even less than me at that moment when I felt good or I felt included in my friends company. Most of the time I wouldn\u2019t, I would constantly field attention, she had a lot of attention and I didn\u2019t and we would hang out at her place or whatever and like her grandma <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">would make me massage her feet (giggling) . We wouldn\u2019t exchange gifts on holidays. One time, the one day they did give us a box of sweets, like her grandma had walked up the stairs and she was like here you go, here\u2019s your present! And I would like run down the stairs and get it, it\u2019s like you\u2019re totally <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">an equal. Knowing my place, that it\u2019s lower and that I have less and that I have less power and less whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: How long did you live with them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t remember. It was in the same city, different area; three or four years, on and off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: What do you mean \u201con and off\u201d? You moved back and forth?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t remember. (nervous giggle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: If you\u2019ll excuse me a minute, I\u2019m just going to get a box of tissues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yea!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">Long pause \u2013 Sirens in background.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Do you think I was traumatized by that experience?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Do you think you were?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, what does traumatized mean? I don\u2019t want to abuse that word or over use it. (nervous gigging)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: So were you renting a room in the house they lived in or different than them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: It was a total residential community, bungalows. The whole neighborhood was like that and then these two families I think they had the same sir name or three families, I don\u2019t know how they were related I think they were like remotely related, I\u2019m not sure. And in one of the bungalows it had <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">like a garage, it was like gated, the whole thing was gated and then there\u2019s a garage and on top of the garage there are rooms with a bathroom, kitchen and we rented that. My dad found that place and we ended up there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Where did come from before you lived there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: From a different part of the city, a much older part of the city. We had to leave that because of the riots. That was where my mom basically grew up and where I grew up, the first six, seven years (siren in back rest of sentence inaudible) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: What were the riots about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: A big thing in 91, 92 between religions. So this was like everywhere in Nepal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: But some areas were less affected than others?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yea, but my city wasn\u2019t so. It was more affected by it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Do you remember the riots? Were you scared?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Did you see violence?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: There was a curfew, so not that much, but in the newspapers yes. My Dad was too scared to live in that neighborhood, the previous neighborhood, because it we were one of the few Nepalese families, so he was scared to live there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561078\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: And this house that you went to after was it safer there? Was it more removed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">long pause<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I wasn\u2019t allowed to play with any of the kids from the first neighborhood. I didn\u2019t really have any friends. Except at school, I don\u2019t even remember what that was like, the first five, six years in school. What kind of social interactions I had in school, I don\u2019t remember. But then also, I faintly <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">remember knowing that this is a rich girl, look at her clothes. She\u2019s always wearing some fancy new ready-made outfit. Whereas I would wear things, frocks my mom would stitch. And that was ok and I think that was very good. Now politically I think it\u2019s good. Then when we moved to this new area, there <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">were kids, and in the same complex. No one like my age exactly, but this girl that I was friends with, two years younger or maybe more. And then this girl whose like reaching puberty early. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: And then her brother was (inaudible, too low)  that was the first time that I had friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Before that, no friends?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Not really no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Who did you spend time with?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Books, my Mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Did you not meet anyone in school before that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: I really don\u2019t remember about those years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Sneezing. \u201cExcuse me\u201d I think it\u2019s just allergies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yea, I get that too. (giggles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Something like power by association (sp?)  I feel like conflicted about it because of these experiences I feel. I go back to these experiences and I worry and I wonder how much do I associate with in that moment, that wasn\u2019t my bungalow. I was just standing in front of it. I just spent a few hours inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">long pause, nose blow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: I feel like that\u2019s a metaphor for things now you know. Like with Chris (sp?) This guy that I like; what does this mean, you spend a few hours with someone and it depends on what you\u2019re doing or doing or obviously conversation isn\u2019t sex, is it. How intimate you are or how connected you are. Or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">maybe it\u2019s the three years you\u2019ve spent with him. How much of their stuff can you lay claim on or should you, to feel powerful by association. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, is that a concrete answer or should I have a concrete answer? And it also depends on where I am. When I\u2019m in Nepal, I definitely feel the need for some lonely (sp?) comment because I feel like I don\u2019t have any other (inaudible)  otherwise. I mean it\u2019s true. It\u2019s an objective truth <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">you could say. And he said it himself, when we were talking about what happened in India this summer when we were with that guy (sp?)  you know, I\u2019d been left alone in a much smaller town for a couple of nights, for many more, and nothing happened to me. And I was like, maybe the people there are nicer, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200832\">they\u2019re rural (sp?) and they have more values, and then I am like well, I don\u2019t know about that, but you were there as my you know almost wife, you know you had a man with you there, that\u2019s why nothing happened to you. Here you didn\u2019t and you kind of made it a point to let them know you\u2019re single. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200833\">there you go. [0019:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561078\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: I mean that is kind of an objective truth and then in context.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: That a woman is powerless when, on her own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yea. And of course you can site that intellectually what you\u2019re writing about and stuff. And maybe in the streets you can protest but in unpractical situations you know when you have to get somewhere and get some work done. Normally, you can\u2019t pick despite of. Your personal safety is your biggest <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">concern. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: So in that sense I\u2019m like ok so it\u2019s not even just power by association it has to be like, I need an association, I need a man, a male escort. All of my friends we talk about this and if that\u2019s the case that\u2019s the thing to be done. Or, you bear the consequences or you develop a thick skin or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">something, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Well, I don\u2019t want to be too concrete about it because you\u2019re talking about a lot of stuff but you don\u2019t live in Nepal anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yea. But even now, maybe this is a different issue but the whole money thing, you know it was a gigantic issue between me and Chris (sp?) and I still feel wrong, accepting stuff, gifts or like going out to dinner and not paying my share. Pause (inaudible)  smaller you know, scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Well, and yet you used to pay for most of your expenses for the two of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: I paid the rent. I think that maybe power was included in certain places. It\u2019s not like Chris (sp?) never pulled out his credit card, I mean he had a huge debt on his credit card. He did pay for stuff.

Like I am weaker or smaller because I can\u2019t pay my share, I mean I could but I choose not to, and I feel bad about making that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">choice. Like you have more and I have less. (nervous giggle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s nice to feel like I\u2019m back, because I\u2019m like a child again, I think that\u2019s what I like. I didn\u2019t really realize till now that that really affected me. Moving into this new area, where the kids where so horrible you know, and made me feel weak constantly, like daily. They had this dog and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">I was so scared of it. One day he was just chasing me and I thought he would bite me. I didn\u2019t really have experience with dogs then. He was just chasing me and barking like no one did anything, everyone just stood still and he just chased me and I ran like a crazy person. I felt really humiliated. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D2\">I was a lot of humiliation, that\u2019s the right word. And then I would do these really back-handed things. Like I would steal from them, steal so like my friend\u2019s mom; which friendthe almost puberty teenager, friends of my mom. Her mom was running a little boutique from the house. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">She had tailors and she would stitch dresses for people and the fabrics would be beautiful and lovely and they would just, and the remainder of these fabrics would just be put in bags and kept in this balcony that we kind of shared with them. Our kitchen door opened into the balcony and they\u2019re back <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">doors opened into the balcony and that\u2019s where they kept all these, so I would just go and take these, the discards of these fabrics and we had a sewing machine to so I would try and stitch garments for my Barbie dolls.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561078\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: That women would get very upset, I can\u2019t remember if she specifically said, don\u2019t take these but, maybe I did all this so (inaudible)  I can\u2019t remember now. They would call that stealing and that I was stealing. One time I had taken a really beautiful piece of something and brought it back and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">to my place and these kids came over, my friend and her elder brother they came over and she she\u2019s stolen this and we have to conduct a search in your house right now. My mom was there and she was like whatever. I asked if she remembered. It was like they were the police and they had a search warrant <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A12\">or something and they searched the whole house or something, I don\u2019t know if they found anything to prove that I was the thief. It was humiliating you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Did you steal, do you think because you were angry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, just jealous. I don\u2019t know. As a kid I don\u2019t know how much thought I put into it except that that\u2019s pretty and I want it and I\u2019m going to take it. (nervous giggle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve stolen other things too. I\u2019ve stolen a book from my school library. I loved that book.

I remember this one was about the shoe maker, that fairy tale about the shoemaker, the elves and the shoemaker. But maybe that was one I actually checked out instead of stealing it, but I can\u2019t be sure. (nervous giggle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: But yea, I remember the constant humiliation from these kids. Will I ever get over that or will I always go back to that every time a guy pays for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: So there\u2019s an element of humiliation in it, feeling like you\u2019re lesser than?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: It colors the whole, a big chunk of the evening. Friday night we went out on a date and he paid for dinner and then he said ok, you pay for dessert. But we just went to this place and had drinks, it just felt weird. I looked at the price of the wine, it was ridiculous for me. Some wines were <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">like $25 a glass (giggle) I could purchase three bottles of wine from the store for that much money (laughing). I was like Oh God, will I have to pay for this, but I didn\u2019t. I just felt really dirty and yucky or something that he just pulled out his card and paid for it, and whatever. It felt like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B72\">I just felt odd about it the whole time. When you\u2019re standing there in the restaurant, it was a weird place. People were eating on tables and then there was this giant table where they in the mornings the butcher uses and then in the evenings they just have people standing around that table, thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B73\">they just come for drinks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: I just felt on display the whole bloody time and like awkward and out of place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t feel like you belonged there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: I guess I was just having flash backs. Last night we went there, he would take me to something similar, like an expensive restaurant where he orders a (sp?)  the bill was $150.00 and I was like, what?! (laughing) I feel very uncomfortable in those situations. I feel like everyone is looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF1\">at me and thinking where in the hell is she coming from. Oh yea she is just his charity case or she looks somewhat pretty, so she is just going to be someone he is going to fuck at night. It just feels like all of those thoughts go in my head.

Whatever she said, I was already afraid somewhere in the back of my head that those were the things that I was afraid of. Oh I hope people don\u2019t think of me as Chris\u2019s girlfriend. I hope no one says you\u2019re not really an artist or you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">know whatever. Where is your stuff that you have produced? What have you done?
