How\u2019s it going?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: You always ask me that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: What? Yeah, I ask. It\u2019s nice to be nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I wonder if that\u2019s part of being polite. We were [inaudible] on that last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, but when I ask you I mean it. I mean it\u2019s not like asking the girl at although, well, I mean it with her, too. I know her now. But it\u2019s not like asking someone you just met who so yeah, yesterday was an interesting day. I\u2019m definitely fighting this like I definitely have a heightened <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">sense of anxiety now, I\u2019m realizing. [00:01:01.04] I just feel because I notice physically I had a pretty bad headache yesterday that in the morning and then kind of throughout the day. And I\u2019m seeing like really, really vivid dreams. So yeah, I just think I think I\u2019m just like antsy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s your dream?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been seeing so many and I\u2019ve not been good about remembering what they are. All I remember about the one last night is at one point I could see my own back of my neck, and I think I mean this, I think, was a little bit I mean I was cutting I cut my own hair, so of course in the back <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">I\u2019m never quite sure what\u2019s going on. And I know that sometimes the hairline back here, I\u2019m I don\u2019t know, it can be kind of long or mullet-like or whatever. [00:02:08.04] So in my dream I could see the back of my and it was just all hair down here. I was like oh shit, I\u2019ve got to take care of that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">And then there was some woman, but I don\u2019t know who the woman was. There were people. I don\u2019t know. None of them...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Just some woman? Did she look like anybody?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: No. No. And it was particularly no, she was youngish, around my age, whatever. But there was nothing really sexual, I don\u2019t think, or anything like that. I don\u2019t know. None of them have been scary or bad dreams per se, just like very vivid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: This dream, what you remember was a vivid metaphor image, discovering something that\u2019s there [inaudible] there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. [00:03:11.23] I\u2019ve been like, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m contemplating I have to go to this fucking bachelor party, another one, this coming next weekend. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know, I just kind of don\u2019t feel like it. But I don\u2019t like that I don\u2019t feel like it. I mean I don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">to get a hotel. I\u2019m staying at my friend\u2019s house. I don\u2019t want to take the bus; I want to drive. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: It sounds like even money aside, there are other feelings as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Something\u2019s going on lately, yeah, like there\u2019s this chick I\u2019ve been like kind of just hooking up with. And it\u2019s kind of like perfect in a way. She doesn\u2019t want anything, and she\u2019s totally fun. It\u2019s awesome. [00:04:02.25] And the sex is actually good. It\u2019s worth it. I\u2019m just kind of every <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">time she wants to get together now I\u2019m just, I don\u2019t know. I make excuses and stuff. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m just so overwhelmed that I just can\u2019t I\u2019m not sure what it is. It\u2019s almost like physically I don\u2019t feel that energetic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: It feels like there\u2019s a lot of [inaudible] today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: As opposed to yesterday?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561726\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not a dream, though, when you turn around and it\u2019s perfectly clean shaven.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: No, it looked weird. It almost looked like an animal in a way. It looked weird. Because there was a hairline, it was just way lower, you know what I mean? It was kind of strange.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: And you felt embarrassed, it sounds like, when you said I\u2019ve got to cut that off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: No, no, it was more just surprised. Like I was almost like wow, who is that. Like it was more just surprise. I wasn\u2019t really embarrassed or anything. [00:06:02.03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Like it\u2019s not you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Kind of, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I mean we\u2019ve been talking about life coaching and [inaudible] psychology yesterday and this whole realm that\u2019s so new that you\u2019re thinking about and trying on for size, even just in ideas, that I mean I think there was some feeling yesterday like who is this person. This is such a new chapter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think maybe that\u2019s what it is. Like each day for me now feels kind of yeah, it\u2019s hard to explain. But yeah, it makes me headachy. You know what I mean? Like I find myself like yesterday I went and I met with a woman that organized the reading that I did at the she\u2019s a director <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">at the museum. [00:07:06.11] And even that, like we took a we just grabbed some iced tea and just walked by the river. It was very nice but I couldn\u2019t help but feel kind of discombobulated a little bit. I was like what am I doing? I never do this. Like I\u2019m walking by the river having an iced tea, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">peach iced tea, like I think it\u2019s like I\u2019m giving myself anxiety by you know what I\u2019m saying? It\u2019s all this like I notice myself, how I\u2019m behaving, and it\u2019s a little (pause) so I mean it could even be like a mild I don\u2019t know about a depression, but like a mild I think even when things are when <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200413\">things changed so drastically, I think it can leave you feeling kind of down or something. [00:08:39.23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: I wonder if something, Brian, about our conversation yesterday [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: No, I was feeling this way before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: You were?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It wasn\u2019t [inaudible] yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] when you came into the session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I mean I also feel more tired now. I didn\u2019t sleep very well last night. [00:09:03.02] Or I slept very, very, very late. I mean it\u2019s not that I\u2019m not upbeat. I just feel a little yeah, I mean my head was hurting yesterday, like I just feel a little bit off, like physically I\u2019ve been feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">off a little bit. Like my even my fucking retainers, they\u2019re bothering me lately. Like I feel like my gum my front teeth is irritated or something. So like that I just feel kind of little things. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I also think even how when you\u2019re having a lot of feeling, it\u2019s the safest layer to register than physical. Physical [inaudible] headache, [inaudible] retainer bothering you. That\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: I mean they\u2019re real things but yeah, they become a bigger thing than they are, yeah.

I mean I think I\u2019m just yeah, I mean I feel overwhelmed. I feel like I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening kind of. All these new things are happening. And I also feel antsy, like I just want it\u2019s as if I want one of either the music or the writing or the life; I just want something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">to go to the next level already. But of course now I totally know that has nothing to do with anything other than me. You know what I mean? So which is both liberating but it\u2019s also makes you anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: And there may also be a lot of other feelings obstructing your [inaudible] be yourself. [00:11:06.03] [inaudible] you asked me Friday [inaudible] you had more time and how you didn\u2019t cry much in here at all and that you\u2019ve thought about that on your own; why is that. You said at one point <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">towards the end how much more can I be feeling and I said actually, a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean it\u2019s probably like there\u2019s a lot of loneliness and all that stuff. Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m thinking right now how much I feel like the couch would help you [inaudible] but I know that also feels like it\u2019s mostly done [ph] stay away. [00:12:34.16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe it\u2019s time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: We can be such a safe container for feelings to come out more. I wonder, though, if it means then you\u2019re really impatient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: That\u2019s interesting. [00:13:01.16] Yeah, maybe. I didn\u2019t think about that. Yeah, it\u2019s more such more of a stereotypical kind of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: And when I get the stereotype level, you know, the clich\u00e9 it\u2019s a couch, but I wonder if just even emotionally actually registering you\u2019re a patient here. It\u2019s not social [inaudible] You\u2019re really here to do work on yourself. You were saying that we\u2019ve had a mode of relating a pattern and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">that pattern could be safe and easy. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: I mean I think the good part in some of this that I\u2019m noticing is maybe it\u2019s just it\u2019s a healthy like self-protection or it\u2019s like I\u2019m actually thinking about what I really need, you know what I mean? [00:14:16.11] Maybe I don\u2019t need to be in San Diego for some bachelor maybe I just don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">want to do that. You know what I mean? I think I\u2019m in a very introspective place where I want to be with my mind. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s kind of seeing the same thing.

Like yesterday, yeah, I didn\u2019t feel good, but it didn\u2019t stop me from going to see Isabella. I think I just some intuitively almost knew that no, just I think I\u2019m just going through a lot of stuff and I\u2019m very <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">like I started this new thing, actually I started it today more adamantly, which is I\u2019m not going to take my laptop with me now. [00:15:06.29] I usually take my laptop with me when I\u2019m out during it\u2019s a fucking waste of time. I go out and what do I do? I just check e-mail and I don\u2019t really write. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D2\">I don\u2019t I\u2019ve got to get back to this writing longhand. I just printed out my manuscript, and I\u2019ve just got to go back to the way I used to do things, and just be with that quiet and just like sitting there. If I have nothing to write then I can just fucking sit there and just be among people and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D3\">so I think I need to there\u2019s something in me that\u2019s being drawn to some kind of quiet, a quiet life, as much as you can make one in a city. The thing is not everyone gets that. I think my friends are going to be bummed if I don\u2019t go. And actually, I\u2019m going to be bummed too. [00:16:01.07] I mean I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D4\">love these guys so it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561726\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: You might even still decide to go, but registering that it\u2019s it doesn\u2019t feel like [inaudible] whether you go or don\u2019t. And that also doesn\u2019t have to be such a bad thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Right, yeah, and at the end of the day they\u2019re my friends. They\u2019re not going to it\u2019s not going to kill our friendship. But it\u2019s just one of those things where you also don\u2019t want to alienate or you don\u2019t want to just be in a cocoon when people want you to be with them. You know what I mean? <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">Like you don\u2019t want to it\u2019s tricky. (pause) I did cancel my gym and join a new gym though. [00:17:15.08] That\u2019s the other thing I did yesterday. Saved like $40 a month, so that\u2019ll be good. Except I definitely it\u2019s that time. You know how you just know you\u2019re going to start exercising. I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200712\">if you feel that way but I tend to just know when I\u2019m going to start exercising again. And this place has racquetball courts, and I used to like to play racquetball. So I figure if nothing else I\u2019ll just fucking go in there by myself and knock it\u2019s so awesome. So I\u2019ll do that. And my friend that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200713\">went fishing with is a member there, so he wants to (pause) You know what\u2019s interesting, though, now that I\u2019m thinking about it. [00:18:15.15] I mean yeah, my gum was kind of bothering me yesterday, and I started getting paranoid because I\u2019m like fuck, I don\u2019t have dental insurance. That\u2019s a lot of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200714\">money. And what\u2019s going on here. Like I hope I started my mind went fucking gum disease or whatever the fuck. And I was like I don\u2019t think I have gum disease, but I don\u2019t know. You never fucking know what\u2019s going on. And I mean it\u2019s definitely irritated here, so I think it\u2019s from the retainer, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200715\">I was like why now. I\u2019ve been wearing it for years. Why is it suddenly and it\u2019s like really bothers me. Like I wear my retainer and then after a few hours I you know that itchy feeling, like that shitty itchy it just I don\u2019t know what the fuck it is. So anyway, so I found myself like I went <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200716\">to like CVS, I went to Star I mean like it filled time. [00:19:09.20] Now that I\u2019m thinking about it, it kind of like really was it that big of a deal? I mean I have mouthwash, I have floss, I have I\u2019m good about home remedy, solved in warm water. I know how to fucking but now that I\u2019m thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200717\">about how I do these things it really is a way I think to it just kills time and also gets me out of the house kind of. I\u2019m just out. And I even wasn\u2019t even thinking straight. Two things happened last night. I went to Star Market and I saw a baking soda toothpaste kind of thing. And I bought it. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200718\">read it and I bought it. I get home, it\u2019s not they\u2019re refill cartridges for you know what I mean? [00:20:03.10] I was like what? Just not thinking. I read the fucking box and it just you know what I mean? That\u2019s one. Then even worse, at CVS, I had two mouthwash things in my hand. I\u2019m like online <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200719\">on my phone reading about does any of this shit even work or what am I spending money on or whatever. I panic, so I go to check if my phone\u2019s in my pocket. I literally like flipped out for three seconds. My phone was in my hand. I\u2019m checking online, you know what I mean? I was like what the fuck. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007110\">I was like I\u2019m out of it today. I\u2019m just not I\u2019m so I think there\u2019s just a lot on my mind and it\u2019s just...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561726\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a lot of turbulence inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, as much as there\u2019s a lot of good stuff, I just it\u2019s very...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: Turbulence settles somewhere and [inaudible] bad either. [00:21:08.04] this bad [inaudible] I just don\u2019t think it applies anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. [00:21:14.10] That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re functioning in so many ways.

That means it\u2019s going to come out and settle in new places that are healthier. But while it\u2019s coming out it feels really [inaudible] (pause) So killing time: why do you need to kill time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: I think I just get restless. There\u2019s so many evenings when I get restless around like 9, 10 o\u2019clock. [00:22:04.00] I don\u2019t feel sleepy at all. I feel very awake and I feel restless, especially the weather is nice or whatever. What is there to do. I don\u2019t I\u2019m not going to bars much or whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">I just take a little drive and what\u2019s open? What bums me out about that is it\u2019s a small proportionally not as bad, but that\u2019s kind of what my kooky aunt does in Portsmouth, right. At all hours of the night she\u2019ll be just out. Sometimes just driving and going to CVS and this. That\u2019s the sign of, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200812\">you said, just a turbulent mind. Like it\u2019s not there\u2019s something going on that isn\u2019t finding an outlet and is masking itself with these other kinds of things. [00:23:09.10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: What does it feel like when you say [inaudible] restless. Where do you feel it in your body?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: It\u2019s hard to say. I mean lately it\u2019s been like just a headachy, even like almost in my face or something, like a little headachy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: Like a kind of tightness almost?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, kind of. Yeah. And then you\u2019re not breathing right kind of. It\u2019s like kind of it\u2019s not pain but it\u2019s like a you\u2019re wound up kind of, so you feel a little something. So sometimes I\u2019ll realize that. I\u2019ll take a deep breath. Well I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m breathing right. [00:24:03.11] <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">You know what I mean? Like I think because I think I might hold my breath some -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: You might not be, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: What\u2019s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: You might not be [inaudible] tension.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, and you don\u2019t realize it. Or my shoulders, I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m just like this or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s a lot of tension.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Big time. Oh yeah, yeah. I mean I\u2019ve said, right, every time the few times I get a massage, they\u2019re always like holy shit. And then like total inability to concentrate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: What happens? Your mind will [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Like so even Netflix isn\u2019t working. You know what I mean? I can\u2019t, you know what I mean? Like even when I put on my favorite comfort food show like The Office or something, I\u2019m just kind of not really relaxed. (pause) So then I\u2019ll be like jumping from one website to another to another, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">I\u2019ll just constantly be (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561726\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s almost like roaming around ends up feeling soothing to whatever is that antsy, anxious feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah, because in some ways driving, even though we do it so naturally, right, but you do have to be it does make you kind of put other things on hold a little bit because you\u2019ve got to focus on the road or whatever. Or when you\u2019re in a CVS or something, you\u2019re looking at products, you just <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">you see some other people wandering around. [00:26:02.25] You just somehow it\u2019s not great but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: It pulls you out of your head a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: A little bit, yeah, yeah, a little bit. I mean in some ways that\u2019s how you know you\u2019ve got to go to the gym. I think that\u2019s what the gym does. It\u2019s I mean other than obviously important to be coming here, but I just mean there\u2019s some energy that needs to be released, and if nothing else that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">at least a good way to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] physiological [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, when you\u2019re exercising you can\u2019t think. There\u2019s no time to sit there and dwell, and it literally forces your brain to empty itself. At least for me it does. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: And it also may be time to go to the couch. [00:27:09.05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think about that. I think I know that that\u2019s what I should be doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: What do you think about [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m shy. I just feel embarrassed to do it. But I know that it\u2019s I have no doubt that it would help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: And embarrassed [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It just makes me feel self-conscious. It\u2019s just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I wonder about that. I mean people have all different reactions to the couch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: I have no idea. I think it\u2019s because I don\u2019t know what to expect. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to feel. [00:28:02.07] And then just on a superficial you don\u2019t well I\u2019m that person that lies on the couch. It\u2019s just kind of it makes I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not a bad thing at all, but it just <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">makes me feel self-conscious. In a way it\u2019s like coming here in the beginning, right. It took me quite a while. So some people I think are more resistant because they bring some skepticism or they bring whatever. Or they\u2019re just scared of whatever the fuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Who\u2019s that person, when you say I\u2019m that person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Just like it\u2019s that superficial layer of just a stereotype of someone who goes to a shrink and lays on a couch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: See, that\u2019s what I mean. Who is that person in your head?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] coming to mind. That\u2019s a weak person? That\u2019s a...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Oh, no, no.

There\u2019s some other meaning in your mind about what that person means. Is that just someone who\u2019s sick, who\u2019s really crazy.

I think that other stuff is that falls away very quickly. I think it\u2019s just fear of and just embarrassment of just feeling a little awkward, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D91\">what am I going to say or feel or and then it\u2019s a big change.

You\u2019re saying you have been thinking about it. In some ways you might know you can start to see how that might be helpful. So all this anxiety stirring about, being antsy for something to happen in your external life could be also about here, and it could be that it <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">happens and you feel tremendous relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">CLIENT: Right, that\u2019s true.
