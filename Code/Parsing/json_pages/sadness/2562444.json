Just trying to get stuff done before I sort of sit down and I can\u2019t get back up again, if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really frustrating because I do have a [lot instances] (ph) in my life time, you sit down, relax, don\u2019t worry about it and it\u2019s very difficult for me to get through to them that if I do that my joints become so stiff that I won\u2019t be able to get back up again. They sort of get it but I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">really want to have that conversation again, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: So, but I really hate the fact that my life is sort of driven by these spurts of I wouldn\u2019t say panic driven but a definitely super focused super high industry, \u201cI must get all this done now because I know that if I sit down for just a minute or if I slow down for just a minute than things <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">are going to start hurting.\u201d And I\u2019m not a person that really likes having that kind of I mean, I don\u2019t mind having like a period of time where I intently do something for a project but this is more like, \u201cI must to empty the dishwasher, I must do this, I must do that,\u201d because if I don\u2019t -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not going to be done.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: (sighs)  Feeling overall just a bit burned out right now, you know? And (pause) I\u2019m just hoping to get some sort of positive (pause) how do I explain this, it\u2019s like waiting for some things to go my way just a little bit, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Which is hard. One of my favorite quotes ever was by I think Thomas Jefferson is that, \u201cI\u2019m a great believer in luck. The harder I work, the more I have of it.\u201d And that\u2019s sort of a deep philosophy of mine. That you have to make your own luck sometimes.

(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">But it\u2019s hard also because [I am] (ph) just like seeing Mike having more and more like aches and pains and this and that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Oh really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, he\u2019s had some problems though. He has some problems with his foot and it\u2019s a couple different things. It\u2019s been there for years. (pause) It sort of had albeac (ph) injections in it and the last time he got injections in he was on crutches for a little bit and this and that. But I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">feel that every single one of them, they\u2019re all interrelated. Because something happened he\u2019s changing his gait which is bothering his lower back. He didn\u2019t even realize his lower back was bothering him until he actually asked about the fact that, \u201cWhy is it that when I go to do X, Y, Z that I\u2019m having <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">muscle spasms?\u201d And they were like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a lower back problem.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: So, and I\u2019m really trying to get the big picture of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562444\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Especially for me. It\u2019s been a long term fight to get him to carry less stuff with him. He really wants to carry the western world with him and it\u2019s heavy. It\u2019s really heavy. And that can\u2019t be good for him. So, amongst many other things like that and it\u2019s just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Mhm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: One of the really really wonderful things though is we calculated the perfect, because for a while there it was almost impossible for him to really walk any distance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I mean he hit (ph) some distance but he couldn\u2019t get back and forth from say, where the center is on campus -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Roughly because his building is right next to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: All the way out to where we are.

Basically where the medical buildings are at Yale. The one that\u2019s actually on, I think it\u2019s on Ballston Street.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, the university health center.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

If you hail it from there and then you do a very specific route, it\u2019s not cheap but it\u2019s about five bucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Which at that point it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, five bucks for you not being in agony, yes.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s kind of funny about that kind of thing because we had to use a bunch of different techniques for figuring out ways to make it Like even from the front, $3 more. Because they had to get up and around and around -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: (inaudible overlapping talking at 00:05:54)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah. But it\u2019s really been helpful because it\u2019s these little life hacks that we\u2019re figuring out are I mean, they\u2019re not great for a budget but they\u2019re making it so that he\u2019s before he wouldn\u2019t do it at all. He would just limp home because, quite frankly, by the time he walked to Yale station, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">if he took it to Central, he still had a half-mile home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: You know, instead of the mile walk home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: But again, able-bodied not a big deal but in the snow and all this other stuff, bad. And as both of us had a lot of that happen where like I\u2019m having trouble with this or that and trying to figure out ways to get around and it\u2019s fairly tricky. One of the big things that well, term, that hasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">been able to It\u2019s sort of a weird thing because people nagged him for years about why he didn\u2019t ride a bike and he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, the reason why I don\u2019t ride a bike is not that I don\u2019t want to ride a bike People tried for years to teach me how to ride a bike, I can\u2019t.\u201d Now, after all these years, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200712\">back when we had the big thing where they were doing the scans for his brain -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: They found out that he has, I can\u2019t remember what it was called, but basically it is where the base of his brain descends a little bit lower than everybody else outside the skull cavity. It\u2019s very little. But apparently people like that have terrible balance problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562444\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Huh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah.

So that\u2019s nice to have the official, \u201cOkay, people like this \u201c And I used to remember what the name of it is but of course I have massive aphasia lately because of stress. But it\u2019s basically this kind of thing. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a big deal it just means that he can\u2019t ice skate, he can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">ride a bike, anything that involves balance like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Not going to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s good because people, like my parents are like \u201cHey, do you want to (inaudible at 00:07:45) town on bike?\u201d You know and I\u2019m like, \u201cAhh, no.\u201d Now I can finally (ph) explain to my mom -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: It isn\u2019t just a matter that he hasn\u2019t gotten because and we\u2019re well-meaning people like my mother are like \u201cWell, maybe we could get a different type of bike or we could do this or we could do that.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.

In his person he\u2019s seeing, he is basically encouraging him heavily to get into it a forgiveness aspect with his mother.

And I\u2019m certain that he doesn\u2019t Like I say, it\u2019s one of those things where he\u2019s been pushed for this. Like he is such a fearer of not just his mother but people that are like his mother. Like the wife of our landlord, he is terrified of! She doesn\u2019t look that much like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201151\">his mom but she has a lot of characteristics of the personality that his mom puts out to others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: Like in terms of being very his mom seems very progressive, very granola-y but actually like, seems like that and seems kind of quirky but actually there\u2019s like a whole lot brewing on the inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">CLIENT: Like she seems like a really nice person and so our landlord\u2019s, you know the lady Marla, she\u2019s a little bit like that too but there\u2019s something about maybe the way her kid is and the way she speaks or something like that.

Like people who look like her, sound like her, might have the same beliefs of her, he is flipping\u2019 terrified.

So she still had that perception of \u201cYou just don\u2019t do these things unless it\u2019s really bad.\u201d So she didn\u2019t know she had diabetes until they were taking her leg off. That was approximately <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201871\">back in 1997 96. And my uncle Mike also diabetes is very very strong in my mom\u2019s family.

And diabetes itself is a type 2 not so much but type 1 is an autoimmune disease, which I\u2019m already prone to. The problem is, is that it\u2019s really muddled <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B1\">because there\u2019s actually both the diabetes 1 present and then also just from bad eating habits that he\u2019s used to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">CLIENT: Anyways, so I\u2019m talking with my mom and he\u2019s back.

And she\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d (pause) To me it\u2019s been <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A71\">inevitable but I think it\u2019s a really big strain to hear because knowing that my mom\u2019s siblings that are all under the age of 70 are dying is kind of stressful because I don\u2019t really want to lose my parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.

A lot of people just put their fraternity life behind them <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202391\">and sort of like especially as a woman as a member of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">THERAPIST: They feel a lot like family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">CLIENT: They feel a lot like family.
