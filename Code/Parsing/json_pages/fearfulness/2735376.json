Did you cut bangs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I got a haircut.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: So . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I felt good about our couple\u2019s session on Wednesday, so that\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: How so? You talked about sex?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: No, we didn\u2019t, actually. We talked slightly about the sleeping situation. That was the first part Dr. Farrow brought up and she suggested that we not try to sleep in the same bed for a month, although she said if there was a night that I felt okay, that I could try it if I wanted.  So I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">that was a tiny bit frustrating because it\u2019s been close to three months. Not that there is a right or a wrong amount of time and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s different for anyone after something like that, but I said to her that it seemed to me that part of a healthy, normal marriage would be sleeping in the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">bed. She said, \u201cI realize that\u2019s your idea of a healthy relationship, a marriage, but it\u2019s different for all kinds of couples. A year from now you could still not be sleeping in the same bed and you could be seeing me or not seeing me. It might just be . . .\u201d (sighs) So on the one hand, I guess it feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">nice to know that she takes what happens seriously enough to not pressure or say \u201cthis is what a typical marriage looks like and you should be striving for it;\u201d not putting on any types of pressures or goals.  On the other hand, I think for me, someone who is pretty typically goal-oriented, it\u2019s hard <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">to have nothing in mind to be striving for. I guess I also feel like the idea of sharing a bed, if you\u2019re married, to me it seems like the norm. It seems like something you would even take for granted. That seems just like eating dinner with your spouse would seem or sharing a bathroom \u2013 (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200175\">all kinds of things that would just be part of what you pretty implicitly signed up for when you got married. So I think that\u2019s a little tough. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t sign up for getting assaulted, so that changes the expectations and what I think is important, though, is that you\u2019re figuring out what feels right to you. Not what Dr. Farrow thinks, not even what I think, not what society thinks or doesn\u2019t think, but what is right for you and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">Ivan and in a negotiation of what feels right and comfortable for you and what feels right and comfortable for him; and I don\u2019t think there is a right answer about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s tricky for me because, on the one hand, as I was trying to describe, our relationship is kind of bizarre right now because on the one hand, we\u2019ll have dinner together and we\u2019ll talk about our day. We\u2019ll relax together and we\u2019ll have fun. It will be wonderful and I feel like we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">really moving forward and this is good. Of course, I wish it had happened sooner, but it feels really positive.  And I\u2019m feeling more and more inclined to kind of confront my own discomfort with certain physical parts of the relationship and stuff like that, because that feels important \u2013 not the most <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">important thing in the world, but it feels important to continuing to make things healthy and establishing or achieving what we had originally hoped for. So there is that, and there is the other part where we have these conversations and we do couple\u2019s counselling and then sometimes in those moments, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B3\">of course, we\u2019re talking about the websites and we\u2019re talking about the assaults and we\u2019re talking about really troubling things, obviously. In those moments it feels like a completely different relationship and it feels hard to go back and forth sometimes. I think I\u2019m getting a little better at integrating <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B4\">that they are both true and that one doesn\u2019t overcome the other. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735376\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: My guess is that\u2019s probably where Dr. Farrow is coming from and is almost just trying to give you permission or have you acknowledge that it\u2019s okay if you take another month. It\u2019s part of her not just wanting to shut out that that happened and pretend it didn\u2019t. Do you know what I mean? And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">so you could say back to her if you wanted to, \u201cI\u2019m actually not doing that. I am ready to have him back in the bed and I\u2019m very aware of what happened last time. It\u2019s going to be scary.\u201d But my guess is that\u2019s where it\u2019s coming from, to really keep honoring the fact that that happened and have it be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">part of the story right now as you\u2019re figuring out what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It did. We tried two different nights this past week and I initiated it. Ivan is never asking, which is still good. So the first night, it was okay and then I woke up really early in the morning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: \u201cInitiated it,\u201d like sexual contact or just to be in the bed together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: No, like \u201cwould you like to sleep in the bed tonight? That feels okay to me.\u201d So the first night I felt okay, and then I woke up really early in the morning, at some point, and I just felt scared and I said, \u201cIvan, I\u2019m sorry. Would you mind moving to the couch?\u201d and then I fell back asleep for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">a while and then, still pretty early in the morning, I said, \u201cIvan, why don\u2019t you come back to bed? I feel okay.\u201d So we tried that and that was not ideal, but it was okay. And then last night Ivan slept in the bed and he came to bed after I did, but it was okay. I didn\u2019t wake up scared during the night. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">And so part of it surely is still being scared from what happened, but also it took me a long time to get used to him not sleeping in the bed initially, and I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s not just getting used to someone else being in the bed again. That\u2019s part of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: But I do wonder if we can have more nights that are positive and I feel okay. That would be a good thing to build on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: You may need just the exposure to the once-frightening situation over and over and over again and sort of start to breaking the fear, breaking that that automatically is frightening, to have it be that you kind of live through it a number of times where nothing happens and everything is fine <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">to let the anxiety calm down. I think that\u2019s part of what you\u2019ve been saying. \u201cIt almost feels like I just have to get used to this again.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t think I feel good about the part (sighs) . . . I think I could go a year and say, \u201cI\u2019m still really angry that this happened and I\u2019m still really scared and I\u2019m still really . . .\u201d  I think that could easily happen, but I don\u2019t think that would really be helpful to either of us. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">I guess I would like to say that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt like I\u2019m punishing him, but I don\u2019t want to keep using that as a reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735376\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I wonder, Ramona, do you feel like you could share that, what you just said, about your thoughts about what Dr. Farrow is saying? Can you share that with her? \u201cI hear what you\u2019re saying, but I kind of feel like this is where I am.\u201d Just sharing yourself, because I think that would be helpful <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">for her to know when you\u2019re just thinking about something or you\u2019re thinking something isn\u2019t actually where you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: I think I did, kind of. I think I did; and she said, \u201cI understand this is frustrating.\u201d Also, it feels like sometimes in our sessions, clearly we\u2019ve got some really important things to talk about and we did spend the majority of the session talking about the websites and processing that; and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">that felt really helpful because we were getting stuck at home in our conversations.  That was really great. It was a really great use of time. And because of that, because there are those big things that we\u2019re still trying to work at, it feels like smaller things, like Ivan sleeping in the bed or has <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">it been close to a year since we\u2019ve had sex, things like that, that I\u2019m already embarrassed to talk about and have kind of been taught that it\u2019s inappropriate to talk about, don\u2019t feel as important or appropriate to bring up. But I don\u2019t know anything about couple\u2019s therapy or marriage, I guess, in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F3\">general; but I get the impression, I get the thought, the intuition that not sleeping in the bed together for a really long time or not having sex for close to a year, that even though there are things that may be going on and that there is a real reason that it\u2019s not happening, that could become a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F4\">problem in and of itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: You mean in other words, does it take on a life of its own, aside from the fact that there were problems that caused you to stop having sex to begin with? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: Right, that you can\u2019t just say because there were legitimate problems that caused that, that that isn\u2019t an issue. And I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s right if we\u2019re trying to move forward and we\u2019re trying to gradually \u2013 I don\u2019t know that we just dismiss it because it\u2019s awkward to talk about in couple\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">counselling or because there are bigger things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: No. It\u2019s the very place that you want to be talking about it and what a lot of couples talk about in couple\u2019s counselling is sex and things like that, intimate parts of their lives that are working and not working. I think I would just keep framing it, though, as this is a question to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">asking yourself. I don\u2019t really answer for you. This is for you to ask yourself where we are and what are we ready to be talking about?  Let\u2019s say a couple comes in and the man has had an affair and there is devastation. So they start working on the betrayal and what wasn\u2019t working in their relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200352\">that that happened. It takes a lot of work on that to get to a place where you\u2019re interested in having physical contact with each other again, right? That is not to say that maybe one of the factors was that they were both so scared to have sex with each other, that they didn\u2019t for a long time. That <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200353\">has to get addressed in their couple\u2019s therapy also if the relationship is going to work, but if the question is \u201care you muscling through trying to reach that problem?\u201d without having created a real platform of feeling like, \u201cYeah, I want to work on that problem. I feel safer. I feel better in this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200354\">relationship. We\u2019ve done a lot of processing with this stuff. I don\u2019t feel as angry about the betrayals. I\u2019m ready and wanting to start working on this other part with you;\u201d versus feeling like you need to get to that because that\u2019s what married couples do and we had better look like a married couple <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200355\">really soon or else there is a major problem here.  Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735376\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">CLIENT: I do. I do. And I think we\u2019ve actually not done a ton of things that a typical healthy married couple would do because we\u2019ve acknowledged . . . I mean, Ivan lived somewhere else for three months. I think we\u2019ve done some significant things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I mean. So you\u2019re wanting to work on bringing up sex in couple\u2019s therapy. Is that coming from a kind of pressured place, like \u201cwe should be doing this,\u201d or does it feel like, \u201cNo, I feel actually like we\u2019ve really done a lot of trust building in processing?\u201d Not that you won\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">continue to do that, but enough has happened that there is a foundation now where you\u2019re feeling like you might want to work on intimacy.  Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: Right. And I feel a mix. I feel like Ivan and I have worked harder and harder to integrate things that we should be doing as a healthy couple \u2013 things like talking about our days when we get home or sharing a meal together. This is the point of the conversations three times a week, to tackle <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B1\">those issues. I don\u2019t know. I guess I feel like we\u2019ve come pretty far there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve done a lot of work on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it\u2019s been consistent and I feel really good about that. But when it comes to the physical part, we\u2019ve done some, but I guess I don\u2019t want . . . It\u2019s so uncomfortable to talk about. I guess I don\u2019t want another year to go by and the most we\u2019ll ever do is kiss or make out and it\u2019s because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F1\">these really serious things happen; because I think it could be, on the one hand, kind of fair to say that. It\u2019s not made up. It\u2019s a real trauma in the marriage, but on the other hand, I think at some point you don\u2019t have to pretend that it didn\u2019t happen or completely let it go, but you also can\u2019t be <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F2\">like, \u201cWe can\u2019t do this, this, this, and this because . . .\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: Absolutely. Or it\u2019s funny that the trails could be, for a long time, the leading reason why you\u2019re not having sex, but you could be reaching a sort of tipping point where they become \u2013 and I know this is a weird way of being \u2013 but almost a kind of way of avoiding sex because it\u2019s scary or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">avoiding working on intimacy, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: Oh, no. I think that\u2019s very clear in what Ivan describes sometimes. He talked about the websites last week and he describes it as \u2013 this sounds bizarre; it was bizarre \u2013 but he said it\u2019s almost like white noise, like the website, like a platform for thinking about things that he wanted, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">wasn\u2019t allowed to talk about with me and didn\u2019t feel like he deserved to talk about with me, couldn\u2019t address, couldn\u2019t bring up. It was a terrible thing to even want and Dr. Bourd has described it as a depersonalized state.  He is so much thinking about that with me and it sounds bizarre and I\u2019m a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200432\">little reluctant to accept it, but it highlights to me Ivan doesn\u2019t feel okay about approaching that topic and I don\u2019t either. I wouldn\u2019t talk about that normally anyway, but I almost feel like \u2013 and this is me; I\u2019m not blaming Dr. Farrow \u2013 but I feel like I\u2019m waiting for permission, like it\u2019s okay <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200433\">to sleep in the bed. You\u2019re okay enough to do that. It would be okay if you felt comfortable and you wanted to have sex that would not be you being a doormat or us saying that the trails are okay; and I don\u2019t know what to do with that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735376\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">THERAPIST: I definitely don\u2019t think it would be, for one, as long as you were feeling like you were interested. It is being a doormat if you\u2019re feeling like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to go anywhere near him, but I feel like I should for his sake,\u201d or for some other prescriptive societal sense. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200451\">That\u2019s different. If you\u2019re feeling like, \u201cI want to try this, even though I\u2019m terrified of it. I don\u2019t know what to do and it\u2019s hard to even talk about it, but I kind of feel like this is worth working on for me, for where I am.\u201d That\u2019s not being a doormat. You\u2019ve had plenty of time. I think there <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200452\">are ways even working on your sexual life could help some of the anxiety of the betrayals calm down. I know that sounds a little strange to say, but if you and Ivan knew you were being more intimate and could just work on that with each other, then the reasons for the things going into bubbles that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200453\">have nothing to do with each other, start to disappear.  You\u2019re actually daring and working on bringing it into the relationship and sharing it more, Ramona. So I think absolutely it can be helpful if you\u2019re feeling like, \u201cThat\u2019s kind of where I am. We\u2019ll keep working on this other stuff, but we\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200454\">done a lot of work on it, enough that it feels like that\u2019s worth trying.: I wouldn\u2019t want it, for example, like you start to kiss him and you feel like, \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t do this. This is traumatizing,\u201d or something along those lines. \u201cAll I can think about is the list\u201d or things like that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200455\">But also with that, Ramona, people don\u2019t know. When couples have had whatever form of betrayal or hurt happen between each other and they start trying to connect again, whenever they do in a physical way, it\u2019s up and down how it goes. It\u2019s not a linear process. You can have one day that it feels great <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200456\">and it is exciting and another day where it doesn\u2019t feel good and you\u2019re brought back to old stuff and you have a conversation about old stuff again.  But I\u2019ve heard you say that you\u2019re ready to start working on this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">CLIENT: We made out over the weekend and it was nice, but I was really scared. Yeah, I was really scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">THERAPIST: Do you know of what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">CLIENT: It was nice because Ivan and I just started kissing and then we started making out more, but he would ask, \u201cIs it okay if I put my arm around you like this or if I do this?\u201d and that was nice and I felt good about that, but I also said, \u201cIvan, I just don\u2019t want you to get mixed messages or the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B1\">wrong message.\u201d He was like, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I understand what this is and what it isn\u2019t and I understand that it doesn\u2019t mean . . .\u201d because I don\u2019t want him to ever think that that means . . . I think that\u2019s really been one of my worst fears.  I don\u2019t know \u2013 that the websites were okay or, even if he <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B2\">wasn\u2019t really thinking about the thought of having an affair, that it wasn\u2019t hurtful.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735376\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think he is going to forget that. I don\u2019t think it means that at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004F\">CLIENT: I also don\u2019t want him to think . . . Something that has come up again is, \u201cIvan, I wish you would write something for me. I would really love to hear positive things. \u201c<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20051\">THERAPIST: Write me a love letter or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s hard for him. He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019ve sat down a number of times and I just don\u2019t think I could ever write something that\u2019s complete or right.\u201d It sounds typical of Ivan, but it\u2019s also kind of frustrating because I\u2019m clearly not asking for a . . . It could be a sentence. (chuckles) It doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200531\">have to be the only thing he ever gets to say to me and it has to be perfect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">THERAPIST: Have you said that to him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)  Maybe it\u2019s even scary for him. As much as I feel like I\u2019ve been rejected, I think he\u2019s felt pretty inadequate, so that\u2019s hard. I said, \u201cIvan, I actually want you to know that is hurtful to me,\u201d because I explained to him that in the beginning when we first started working, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200571\">I felt like there was really a lot of harsh criticism from me. I felt like most times it was based in something very legitimate that I had the right to be upset about at whatever level. Maybe not initially, but eventually it would come out really harsh or cruel \u2013 really unproductive ways of saying it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200572\">I feel like I\u2019ve worked exceptionally hard and we\u2019ve now gotten to the point where it\u2019s pretty minimal that I\u2019ll say anything and when I do, I try to be exceptionally tactful and I try to frame it instead of \u201cyou didn\u2019t do this\u201d more like \u201cIvan, I would really appreciate it if you could . . . That would <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200573\">be great.\u201d  But I said I sometimes worry that we get to be at the other end of the spectrum where I\u2019m not saying anything or I pretend like something doesn\u2019t bother me as much because I don\u2019t want to be critical because that\u2019s been really highlighted in our couple\u2019s counselling. I think it was even <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200574\">highlighted to the point where, while Ivan was making these websites or doing these things, that\u2019s what we were talking about those weeks. The problem even just became that I was critical, not that Ivan was not doing whatever when, in fact, they both were, to a certain extent. So I told him that sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200575\">I\u2019m scared that he won\u2019t ever write something and that\u2019s my fear, but that I\u2019m scared of that. I told him that sometimes I\u2019m scared that he won\u2019t move on from Subway. Sometimes I\u2019m scared that he won\u2019t reach a healthy weight; and I\u2019m not a horrible person for feeling those things.  I\u2019m not saying it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200576\">in a way that\u2019s cruel or unkind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the difference. That\u2019s the difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">CLIENT: I would love you to reach your potential and I want you to be healthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Just as he can want you to work on things in you, too. That\u2019s actually a loving thing. That doesn\u2019t have to be scathing criticism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">CLIENT: It felt good to get it out there instead of not saying anything, at the risk of being told that I\u2019m critical. Ivan wanted to take me out last weekend. He wanted to take me out on a date, but I just kept coming up with reasons why it shouldn\u2019t work out. \u201cOh, Ivan. You didn\u2019t really plan in advance. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F1\">Let\u2019s not worry about it. Let\u2019s just watch something on TV tonight,\u201d which he didn\u2019t. He really didn\u2019t plan in advance. He just came up with it that day. While I could say, \u201cI wish you had planned something, but sure; let\u2019s go out,\u201d it\u2019s scary.  It\u2019s so scary to me to make out with him. It\u2019s so scary <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F2\">for me to agree to him taking me out on a date. It\u2019s so scary . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735376\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">THERAPIST: Scary to go on a date because . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20063\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019m scared of being disappointed. So if I kind of cut him off in advance and say \u201cI don\u2019t think you planned anything; I really wish you would and let\u2019s just forget about it and stay in,\u201d that\u2019s so much easier than letting him try to plan something and taking whatever happens. Just like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200631\">I think it\u2019s a lot easier to say \u201clet\u2019s not even think about or talk about having sex,\u201d because the couple\u2019s counselor has even given me a way out of even addressing that; and it\u2019s scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s funny, because I wonder if there could be ways \u2013 how do I put this \u2013 in that dynamic, you\u2019re playing off of each other.  If one of the things you\u2019re worried about is of him planning something \u2013 sort of planning it or not planning it \u2013 really well or in advance and then it\u2019s not great, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200651\">is that he disappoints you and you\u2019d rather not be disappointed. I could imagine that also hovering over writing you a letter. What if it\u2019s disappointing, if you read it and you feel like \u201cthis is all you have to say about me?\u201d He\u2019s terrified, too. As much as you say to him that it could just be a sentence, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200652\">you might be disappointed if it were just a sentence. Do you know what I mean? I think it\u2019s scary for him also, not just because he\u2019s afraid of being rejected. I think that\u2019s part of it and what we\u2019re talking about, but also for him to be so intimate as to write down positive messages, that\u2019s a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200653\">of intimacy.  \u201cThis is what I love about you.\u201d He\u2019s working on that, too. That\u2019s his first step into kissing, for example. In some ways, it\u2019s even more intimate than kissing to say \u201cthese are all the things I love about you.\u201d I think what could help you talk about this with him is you\u2019re not saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200654\">\u2013 fundamentally, at least \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m critical. I\u2019m worried that you will never be able to write something because then you\u2019d be a disappointment to me.\u201d I know it could even feel that way inside you. But in a different way you\u2019re saying, \u201cI hope that whatever makes this scary for you is something we can <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200655\">change so that you\u2019re not as scared of saying loving things to me.\u201d Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">CLIENT: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a different twist on it than just that he\u2019ll be disappointing, but rather that his anxiety about himself, about his love for you, about his perfectionism, that those could soften so that he could feel free to write you a few sentences; and that yours maybe could, too, so that you guys <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200691\">can have room for tolerating each other as imperfect. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">CLIENT: I think sometimes, if I say to Ivan that I\u2019m a little disappointed about something, even the note, he hears and I\u2019ve heard him say back and we had a discussion about this that I hope is helpful, he is like, \u201cI\u2019m a disappointment to you.\u201d I said, \u201cIvan, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m allowed <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B1\">to be disappointed about some things, have a small disappointment that this didn\u2019t happen.\u201d One day it was as little as \u201cIvan, do you want to shave?\u201d because he hadn\u2019t shave and he needed a haircut and he didn\u2019t put in his contacts.  He needed to do a little grooming, but it wasn\u2019t like you\u2019re gross, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B2\">get away from me. And he was like, \u201cI\u2019m a disappointment to you.\u201d I said, \u201cBut that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s hard because I think he feels that. Whether or not I said anything, he feels like he\u2019s a disappointment. It\u2019s hard for me to, I think then, not to retreat into not saying anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B3\">and act like it\u2019s not a problem or not scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735376\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it would be helpful to the word \u201csad\u201d instead of \u201cdisappointed?\u201d Maybe he would be able to stomach that a little bit more and actually hear that. In part, Ramona, that is what you\u2019re saying. That\u2019s what\u2019s so funny about the slight connotation of the word \u201cdisappointed\u201d versus <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006D1\">\u201csad.\u201d Disappointed implies there is something I don\u2019t like about you.  Sad implies more like I really wish you would do this for me because it\u2019s important to me and you didn\u2019t and it makes me sad. I just wonder if he could own more of the thing you\u2019re talking about, whatever it is, instead of immediately <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006D2\">hearing you saying you\u2019re disappointed and he\u2019s a disappointment.

He may go there anyway with sad, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve tried that a little bit, at least around the note thing, the card thing. I said \u201cI feel sad\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s a little hurtful\u201d or \u201cI worry that maybe you don\u2019t have anything to say. Even if that\u2019s not true, that\u2019s how it can feel to me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20071\">THERAPIST: Is he able to say why he hasn\u2019t so far?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20073\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a couple of reasons and one of them is that since he wrote or created the websites or the lists, he\u2019s like, \u201cI feel like all my writing is a bad thing to do,\u201d which is hard for me to take in because it feels like such a cop-out.  It feels like he\u2019s actually using what\u2019s been so hurtful <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200731\">to me as a further weapon. That doesn\u2019t feel okay. And then he also said, \u201cI\u2019ve sat down and I\u2019ve tried and I thought and I thought, but I just couldn\u2019t put together something that is complete or good enough.\u201d I actually think those both might be kind of true for him, but really hard for me to take <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200732\">in because, to me, it boils down to \u201cI didn\u2019t do this because it\u2019s difficult,\u201d which is scary to me because not doing something because it\u2019s difficult is not okay to me. Sometimes I think it\u2019s more of a reason to do something. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20075\">THERAPIST: I also wonder if those aren\u2019t the reasons. You\u2019re pretty sure the first one is certainly not the reason. It really doesn\u2019t make sense that all of writing now is so evil that he can\u2019t write something loving. But even the second one; it just feels like there is some unconscious anxiety, some <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200751\">hang-up about what it means to step into this with you, be that intimate, share what he thinks, that he\u2019s still working on in the same way you\u2019re working on what it means to actually make out and be on the couch together and have his hands on your body; that kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20077\">CLIENT: Is that a possibility, that he really is so afraid of failure that he just doesn\u2019t try certain things?

I know it\u2019s a strange construction, but I believe <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200791\">him when he says that this was really that Ivan said this stuff was about you. It\u2019s more just a reflection of him being so terrified and so filled with guilty feelings about wanting to bring this into the relationship with you, that he couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s the stuff that has to get worked on. It\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200792\">why? Why does sex feel so shameful and bad and guilty that you couldn\u2019t share that with each other more; talk about it?

I don\u2019t want to feel bad about it.\u201d He was like, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel bad about anything.

What does this say about me that I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D1\">having sex with someone or that I\u2019m making out with someone who did this to me?  You could say that. In other words, let\u2019s say he never did any of that. The same kind of feeling could be there around sex. What does it mean about me? Am I gross, dirty, a doormat \u2013 that kind of person \u2013 that we\u2019re doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D2\">these things together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F\">CLIENT: For me it\u2019s always hard to integrate into life and not feel embarrassed, to have that be a normal part of the day or the week or whatever. I think in some ways, it\u2019s too big of a deal for Ivan and me. It just never got to be a normal part of \u2013 I don\u2019t want to use the word \u201croutine\u201d because that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F1\">exactly what people don\u2019t want. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735376\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20091\">THERAPIST: Integrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. Not a huge deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20095\">THERAPIST: You can have dinner together, have sex, and then watch a movie, wake up, brush your teeth next to each other; and have that all be sort of seamless as part of a marriage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20097\">CLIENT: I think on a smaller level, and this sounds horrible, but it\u2019s true for me.  (pause) Sometimes I don\u2019t want to have children yet. I feel pretty sure that I want to have children, but in my 30\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20099\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what\u2019s so horrible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009B\">CLIENT: No, no. (both laugh) No, there is nothing wrong with that. I just sometimes feel scared or have this irrational fear that that can happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009D\">THERAPIST: That you can get pregnant?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. If you even have sex, honestly, and it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t understand birth control. To a certain level, I don\u2019t as much because, like I said, no one ever had these conversations with me. But I think to a certain irrational level, it scares me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A1\">THERAPIST: To get pregnant?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course. That\u2019s not at all what I want and there is no reason why that would need to happen as a result of having sex, but that is something in the back of my head that makes it a little less comfortable.  Also even just thinking Ivan and I feel like we\u2019re in an okay place now and we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A31\">making so much progress and I feel so good about that. I\u2019m feeling so comfortable with him and, obviously, if I\u2019m feeling more comfortable with him physically, what if . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A5\">THERAPIST: That having a baby . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A7\">CLIENT: Well, no. But even the thought of what if tomorrow I found out something crazy? What if tomorrow he finally said, \u201cYou know what? It\u2019s all been a big lie and the websites were exactly what they looked like.\u201d I think that\u2019s unlikely, but I guess my point is that I\u2019m not ready to commit to Ivan <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A71\">in terms of \u201cwe will be 80 years old and old together\u201d yet. Of course, that is my hope that that\u2019s the by-product of all our hard work, that I feel secure. I also feel like he\u2019s making decisions that I would be okay with bringing into a family. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A9\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s so good you\u2019re saying this, Ramona, because here, in a way, you\u2019re articulating your own answer to the question we were talking about at the very beginning. It\u2019s how much are you ready for? What feels right? I think it\u2019s really important that you\u2019re able to say it \u2013 not that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A91\">you shouldn\u2019t be saying this, but you found your own voice and are saying, \u201cThere isn\u2019t enough trust yet that I\u2019m 100% sure that we\u2019re going to be together.\u201d Do you know what I mean? You\u2019re getting there, but you\u2019re not there yet where you totally trust again in every way or that he won\u2019t wake up tomorrow <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A92\">and tell you something that\u2019s shocking. This might sound like a little strange thing to say, but in that way, it\u2019s almost as though where you are is dating. What\u2019s coming to mind is why would Ivan sleep in the bed every night? People sleep in the bed every night when they have a sexual relationship. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A93\"> Otherwise, you don\u2019t sleep in the same bed as your friends, right? That\u2019s why so often I wonder about maybe the leading edge of things actually is how physically intimate you are, rather than getting back to a normal sleep in the bed, sleep in the bed, sleep in the bed; and then eventually you think <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A94\">about kissing each other. No, that\u2019s actually kind of not the way the order of things work. If you\u2019re thinking about dating someone you\u2019re getting to know them; you\u2019re getting to trust who they are; you kiss; you make out; you go to third base. And as that\u2019s happening that\u2019s getting more and more introduced <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A95\">as something you\u2019re sharing with each other. You\u2019re making out and seeing whether that\u2019s okay that that happened. Do I find out something shocking the next day? When he gets what he wants sexually, does then everything else fall off all of a sudden? Do you know what I mean? You\u2019re just trying to kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A96\">of take it slowly, but building trust each step of the way, which I think is what you\u2019re doing.  I just think even thinking about this dating \u2013 when people don\u2019t know each other, you don\u2019t know whether you can trust this person. You kiss them and you see what happens next. Do they get fearful? Remember? <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A97\">You know; that kind of thing. You\u2019re in that place of trying to see if you can build up trust again. Get used to kissing. Live in it for a while. See how it feels until it feels less scary and then you incorporate something else \u2013 starting to dare yourself to hold hands walking down the street, or whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A98\">is the thing that hasn\u2019t happened yet that is not a huge thing. It\u2019s a little scary, but you could try and it\u2019s not so frightening that you then will feel regretful if you find out something shocking or risqu\u00e9 because you\u2019re still in the process of building trust.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735376\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200AB\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s the scary thing for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Which is hard because I think it would be scary anyway. Sex. Even if there were 100% trust, it\u2019s a frightening topic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200AF\">CLIENT: Right. I feel like part of me just wants to know that we\u2019re going to sleep together in the same bed over and over and nothing bad is going to happen and that I don\u2019t have to feel ashamed of doing something like having sex and then the next day, something like that would happen again. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s start, as you\u2019re thinking that, noticing what feels good that you can register as \u201cI like doing this,\u201d even if it\u2019s something as simple as holding a hand or his head on your shoulder or your head on his shoulder \u2013 whatever is a contact that feels good and just letting it register what <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200B11\">is yours that feels good. You don\u2019t want to be pushing into any territory that doesn\u2019t feel good, including being too terrified that you\u2019ll get shocked the next day, but taking it kind of one day at a time, all right?
