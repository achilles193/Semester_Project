I hope it helps. But yea, I don't know what to do to make it this far.

(pause) I just feel uncomfortable for the most part. [0:06:02] (pause for two minutes) Yea, I'm just scared of everything. [0:09:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Like what? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Like putting anything away in our house. We had just closed on the storage unit so we have kind of stuff everywhere. I just don't know how to tackle it. I really ought to. I am usually very good at this. I'm just kind of frozen. [0:10:00] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I feel like you're scared you'll find you really can't handle it at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yea.

(pause) Maybe it's like you've found somebody who's explosive and angry and extremely dangerous. And then maybe you could be easily set off. (pause) [0:12:00] (pause for two minutes) Are you afraid of saying things here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I don't know. Probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: What's clear is that you're just not sure what to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Because things aren't coming to mind, you feel blanked out or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yea. I just I don't feel like I have much to say. [0:15:05] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Do you have a feeling of not wanting to be here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: No. No, I really don't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Just a feeling of not having much to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: OK.

Oh. (pause) You have before felt very like uncomfortable and self-critical when you haven't had much to say. [0:18:05] Because you felt like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: I guess so, yea. (pause) [0:19:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Well, one possibility that occurs to me is that, in general, being able to work I guess in here probably feels related to having things to say helps to make things look and I think also give you the feeling that things are OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: And nothing that intense as long as I have nothing to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">THERAPIST: Something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: Yea. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Usually when you sort of can't pull it together enough to do whatever the work is at hand is you get really scared and really angry at yourself. [0:21:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yea. (pause) I'm not sure if James would even be here.

[0:23:00] (pause for two minutes) I wonder if part of what makes you uncomfortable what I thought is that the work whatever work you're doing is always like a little bit of a sort of displacement from work a little bit of distance from you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Like generally easier to focus on whatever work is at hand which like is kind of you but not exactly you. [0:25:59] And if you can sit there and not doing anything and that's the work, then it really doesn't put a whole lot of distance between you and what you're doing. I feel like I'm getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">a little convoluted. What I mean is it really puts the focus on you and what's going on with you. Or how you're really struggling and scared, I guess. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: I guess I have. (pause) [0:27:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Are you worried I'm going to decide it isn't working because you don't have much to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: I don't know. It could be. (pause) (inaudible at 0:27:27). (pause for two minutes) I worry about how hard this is on James (inaudible at 0:30:11) I guess. (pause) I just feel like he's bound to feel tired of taking care of me.

It's not been immensely easy for me to take things easy. But I've been doing it. (pause) I feel like I can't be around people. Like there's I don't know ideas. I just... it's very scary for me. (pause) I just feel like I'm not entirely (inaudible at 0:35:01). <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">(pause for four minutes) We just had Amanda here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: When did she go home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Sunday (ph).

(pause) How is she the best?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: (chuckling) She's just... she's a very easy guest. And she always has been plans big projects. And she's like, \"No, this will be easy. That is no problem.\" Yea, she just kind of gets stuff done. She's just kind of wants to part of everything which is pretty easy. That's OK. [0:41:04] (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200851\">And James really liked having her here also which is nice. And it was a kind of an automatic thing.
