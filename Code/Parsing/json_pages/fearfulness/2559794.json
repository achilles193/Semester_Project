(inaudible at 00:00:05)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Oh okay. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: So... (SIGH) (PAUSE) So James (ph) and I talked yesterday about a lot of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I talked about like being anxious not knowing where we're going to be and things like that. So, as it turns out, James's advisor is out of money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like he's... All of his grad students next year are going to have to teach because he only has enough money to pay one of them. So James needs to finish by the end of the summer because he, because Kevin (ph) probably won't be able to pay him in the fall. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Right. (inaudible at 00:00:55)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. He'll... Yeah. They like have enough money to (inaudible)  So he really needs to finish by then and be started somewhere else by the fall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Right. I have in practice at least people will often (inaudible at 00:01:17)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Of course, you could finish and then start looking right after and then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: But that won't be an option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. So... (SIGH) (PAUSE) So I talked a lot about like where we needed to be and how much do I need to be in Denver. And I don't know how to answer that question at all. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">You know, it was kind of a, it was a rough conversation because, you know, I hadn't really talked to James about it because I didn't want him to feel like if we did move, it would be, I would be blaming him for that or thinking he's like taking me away from, you know, Denver where my support system <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">is because it's not actually how it is. But he did feel that way it turns out. (LAUGHTER) So I, you know, talked about it. (LAUGHTER) That's not right. We talked some about... (PAUSE) James, at one point, said that it sounded to him like I wanted to be a partner to him but it looked like I wasn't willing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">to do what it took to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">I said, \"Well, no. I want to be a partner to you and I can't be a partner to you if I'm in the hospital. I just can't.\" And so... (PAUSE) Yeah. So we sort of agreed that like the best way I can support him right now is to take care of myself, like, be well. And I don't know... I don't know. But I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">know how to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">I don't know how to trust that. Like I don't know how to get to a place where I don't feel like everything is going to collapse eminently and there's nothing I can do about it. (SIGH) (PAUSE) It seems like James has at least some idea of what he wants to do which is nice. He sort of has come around <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">to thinking that, yes, he really would like to be in academia and he really would like to be... He would really like to have graduate students and would like to be running a lab like that which was not the case a year ago. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">So, yeah, that's nice. (PAUSE) Like, you know, I think he's... I think he's very well suited to it. (PAUSE) So most of the places, I think... I know most of the places. But he definitely is working very hard with the people in Denver and I think he's trying to stay here. But I don't know what that will look like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: I just remember what... I know you said he doesn't like Denver very much.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559794\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) No. I don't think he does. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">But I think he... I think he doesn't like the Square very much. (LAUGHTER) Which, yeah. (LAUGHTER) I can't really blame him. (LAUGHTER) He said that when his parents were visiting, they wouldn't, they didn't want to go on the campus. Like they didn't want to go on Brown campus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: They are funny. So one of the... One of the things that's kind of best option for him right now is kind of this guy who's a (inaudible at 00:06:47) (LAUGHTER) Oh well. And then there's somebody at Dartmouth and somebody at UCB (ph) and maybe somebody in Delaware. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: And there's like several people in Denver.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Where else? Like several other in Denver...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Like Brown and Harvard basically. So if he wants to have the option, then like having graduate students, like teaching at a research university, he basically needs to work with like one of six or seven people. THERAPIST: Right. Yeah. I know what you're saying. Like, if that's what he wants to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">do, then it really comes down to (inaudible at 00:07:41)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, the good news is that he's in a position where he's very competitive for his job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Oh good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. His advisors like... (PAUSE) He's not a member of the academy. I don't think he has a Nobel Prize. But he's not far below that level. Like it's more chance that he doesn't have a Nobel Prize than anything else. And so yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Has he published much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: He's published some. I don't know exactly how much. He's trying to get a bunch of papers out now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Has a collaborator who...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: ...is slow. So that's driving him nuts. Yeah. His research and his like time with Kevin hasn't gone the way he had hoped. So I think it's been really frustrating for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: What does he do? Biomechanics?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Inorganic, synthetic...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Oh okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: He works with precursors. I don't know what those are. Yeah. I don't know what that is. THERAPIST: Is it really materials or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's like... He's sort of on the line between inorganic and materials. He's kind of bouncing back between.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Gotcha. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: But Kevin has told him that he's one of the best grad students he's ever had. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: That's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. I feel like (inaudible at 00:09:31) I'm going to be anxious about... (SIGH) I'm going to be anxious and think that I could slip down into the worst that things have ever been at any second. Like I'm going to feel that way anyway. And so the imminent move or imminent change <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">for James is kind of a convenient thing for me to put that on. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Like I would be worried anyway but here's something I can worry about. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: I think I get it. Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) So we've... I've talked a couple of times about whether Skyping would work if I ended up moving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Right<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: And you said that you weren't sure and like licensure might come into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) I used to do that and then I found out that it's actually, in some instances in another state, it is considered working in that other state usually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: And licensure for psychologists is by state.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559794\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: So, you know, if there is a reasonable way to manage that, I'm happy to work over Skype. I think in most cases there probably isn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: But it sounds like that it would be at least a pretty small number of states to check out. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's like Texas, Montana, and Delaware, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: And Delaware. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Can I ask you to check that out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: If not, I can...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I'll check it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Sure. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) I don't know what licensure for psychologists is like but if it's anything like teaching licensure, it's complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: It's complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Let's see. So there's Texas, Montana, Delaware.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: Is there anything I can do to look that up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, you could look it up as easy as me (inaudible at 00:12:51)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Okay. Okay. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:13:05)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: Thank you. Okay. I'll look at that too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: But if you don't find anything, then I'll look it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: Sure. (PAUSE) You know, in a lot of ways, I'm sort of glad that things have to be moving faster now because it means I don't have to sort of wait around for all of this.  (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">You know, James has said that if we need to stay here, we can stay here. But I don't know what that means right now. I don't know. I don't know... (SIGH) So there's that. But then on the other side, I don't... Neither of us is willing to be held hostage to my emotions is the way that James put it the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B11\">other day. I'm right there with him. But I don't know what the difference between making decisions based on what we will need and being held hostage to my emotions looks like.  I don't know how to distinguish between them. I imagine fear has a lot to do with it. But I don't... (PAUSE) You know, I... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B12\">(SIGH) (PAUSE) It's like I'm so afraid even when I don't notice it that I don't know how to get outside of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: You know, sometimes I think I'm outside of it but I don't... Sometimes (inaudible at 00:15:55)  I think most of my decisions are coming from fear. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: You don't know if you're up for moving and I guess a large part of that is leaving me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. You know, there are other things that tie me to Denver. But... (PAUSE) They aren't things that I don't know that I can replace or live without. You know, like I really like my church but there's Episcopal churches pretty much everywhere. Some of them aren't great and some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B91\">of them are. Like I'll find some place to be.  I really like my job. I... (PAUSE) I feel like I will be able to find another job doing this elsewhere. That will be fine. You know, I don't... (PAUSE) And, you know, like, there are lots of good therapists. But there are lots and lots of bad therapists <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B92\">also. And it's also like good and bad isn't really a fair descriptor. There are lots of people I feel like (inaudible at 00:18:55) or would work very well with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Both of those things are true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Okay fair enough.  But like it's... You know, if I find somebody really good on the first try, I wouldn't be able to just start off where I left off.

(PAUSE) So I just picture myself like having the first several months in a new city without support (CRYING) and trying to start over. And I don't... I feel like now is not the time where I feel ready to start over. Like there have been times in my life where I felt ready for a new thing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">You know? Moving to the Midwest, sort of. Definitely moving to Denver, I felt ready for the next thing. I don't... I don't want that now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.  (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: And I... (PAUSE) I don't want to lose this and... It's like I don't want to lose it so much that it's really hard to talk about it. Yeah. I'm sort of shy about it. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Well, I think that you (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:21:45) talk about particularly bad things that you're feeling in a way that is pretty unusual for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: Can you repeat the first part? I just didn't hear it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Sure. I think you (inaudible) around me...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:22:15) especially bad things that you feel (inaudible) you were talking to. But... (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's sort of hard for me to... Like, it's hard for me to be clear in my mind of exactly like what I rely on you for. So like when I try to tell James about it, I just don't do a very good job. But... Yeah. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">So I was talking with James about this yesterday and he sort of said, \"Well, I mean, do you... Does this mean that you're never going to be able to move out of Denver?\" I said, \"No. I don't think so.\" (SIGH) (PAUSE) Like I see this relationship like drawing to a close eventually. You know, in the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D31\">way that like it's okay for Dr. H (ph) to be in private practice now because like I don't sort of need her in the same way that I did six months ago. But that's not what I am right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Right.  (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: You know, typically that's not how it works or no one would ever accept new patients. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) (CRYING) I'm just really, really scared. (PAUSE)  (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: And I do think I would be really scared anyway. But this is something to be scared about. (PAUSE) Because if I wasn't... (SIGH) You know, if I was not, if we were not worried about losing you, I would be worried that this wouldn't be enough to keep me safe. You know? (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Um... (PAUSE)  (inaudible at 00:28:21) impossible. And you're terrified of losing me now at this stage of things. And (PAUSE) I imagine you know more why than you've said so far but maybe you don't understand why. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: Why I'm terrified? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Of losing me. Why that would be... Why you're so scared of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't... I don't think I do. It's like a try to think about it and I try to analyze it. But it's... The fear is so intense that I can't get... Like my mind can't work it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Yep. That happens. I mean, the fear makes it impossible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's very strange. (LAUGHTER) It doesn't happen that often for me or like with that many things. Like I'm sort of used to being able to... I keep expecting that if I like leave it alone for a couple of minutes and then come back to it, then it'll like have settled down, not that I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E91\">handle it but that I can think about it. Nope.

(PAUSE) I feel like I have a very clear picture of (PAUSE) how much I or how going <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F11\">from a moderately resilient person to someone who just couldn't handle anything in the last few years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">Like that's much more clear to me.
