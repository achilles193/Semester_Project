How's it going?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: So, have you listened to those?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I have listened to a few of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: What's the quality?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Very good, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I'm thinking about maybe getting one just like that. I'm just not good technologically. I have something that's a bigger version of that and I can't \u2013 that seems really easy to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It's been very easy. It's more expensive than they usually are but it's worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: A hundred bucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah \u2013 150.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: (Whispers) (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: You're using it for what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I'd like to try to record our practices and I usually just do it on my iPhone but a lot of times I forget. But that will just keep going right? There's no limit on the time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: A number of hours. Twelve hours or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: So I could just put it on and you can probably edit that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yes. Sure. CLIENT: So yeah, we could just leave it and forget about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: So I decided something yesterday. I was talking to my friend Drake. Not this Drake but another Drake. I got to chill out. The whole, like \u2013 I was up till okay \u2013 get a load of this. So (unclear) are running a different electronic type thing on garage bands. Around like 12 o'clock or so I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">got so absorbed in it that I don't know why, like an idiot I didn't plug in my adaptor, I mean the whatever, it's the Mac, the cord so it shut down. I lost a shit load of tracts. I was (unclear).  So instead of \u2013 the good thing though I was instead of just being like losing it and getting upset I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200332\">up till 5 in the morning redoing it. That's all great, but something's going on here. I mean it's good \u2013 I mean I like it in the sense that that's awesome, I'm in a place now where I'm working, fuck ADHD. I was super focused, you know. But I think I've got to like, when I talked to Drake he liked helped <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200333\">me \u2013 I didn't really say anything but he's been into music and stuff and he's more into promoting and selling and producing and all that, different kinds of music, but still it's the same concept. And he was like, man, you're not going to really see \u2013 he's like you're really not going to see much in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200334\">terms of how the record's been doing not till like six months \u2013 actually like a year. He's like because the life of a record is three to four years. And when he said that in my mind I was like why am I, I'm like constantly \u2013 it's like I've worked so hard on this thing and there's so much pent up \u2013 it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200335\">has nothing to do with the record. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: It's just me. That I just want immediate \u2013 I want people to hear it. I want it to be out there. And it doesn't work that way. It's not the record's fault that I'm bringing psychological issues to it. And then I relate that to the electronics \u2013 it's as if I'm running, I'm sprinting. On the one <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">hand it's good. I feel super like \u2013 that record's done, like I'm just \u2013 the [nomics] (ph).  I'm trying all this experimental stuff. I'm recording, I'm teaching myself how to work. That's great. But I gotta calm down a little bit. You know. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: It does.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100028\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: And even with the electronics. I'm already like, is this really good. It's something like I'm already like being an asshole to myself about it. I just taught myself how to use this thing. I'm making the kind of songs I never would make, kind of dance-y more indie, dance-y stuff that I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">never do. So just fucking relax, just have fun and play it for a couple of friends and make it just be fun. Then if it's something, it's something. You know? Yeah, so that was really good to talk to him just be feel like you know I do have to think of it now like a business kind of. You don't get \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">when you open a practice or whatever you open or start you don't get returns immediately. I mean you gotta be patient and you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I'm glad you've made sense of what you're saying because there has been, it's like a fever pitch intensity for a while that has felt good but part of what you're trying out that two end sides connect and is currently, but it's been intense and maybe there are times where it feels like what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">would happen if you could take a deep breath and kind of go to sleep instead of finish that at night. What would happen if the intensity calmed down a little bit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Well, and the thing I reminded myself too is, again after talking to Drake, the thing feels like I also have to remind myself \u2013 I don't know why I'm not treating this the way I treated my book. I guess poetry is so different. It's just such an internal, intimate, so I wasn't like, oh, well this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">book better win the Pulitzer, you know. I was just excited that it got published by a prestigious press. But with the music I don't feel that way. It's such a mass \u2013 this kind of music is such a mass thing. It's just you can't help it. That part of you, you want people to hear it and validate it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">you don't want it to get lost in the vacuum. But that doesn't make sense. They're both art and you have to be like, you know what? What's it going to matter? Let's say tomorrow a million people hear it. I'm probably going to be as wound up as I am right now. Do you know what I mean? I need to remind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F3\">myself that that's me, it's not a \u2013 and Drake made that point. Like, he was reading my mind while we were talking, but he's like, you know it's never going to be enough. It's like when you work so hard on something that's an art form, it's never, it doesn't matter how well it does, if you're looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F4\">for some kind of something out of it, it will never be enough. Of course, that's totally true. You have heavy rotation on MTV. And then I'd be like, yeah, but that's not really \u2013 I'd find something and I don't want to be like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well if what you're looking for is a kind of deep recognition that it's something you can hold rather than something the masses could provide that they can't provide that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Exactly. Today for example, I woke up and a friend of mine who I haven't seen in years, I mean years \u2013 and even back then we were friends but more like really good acquaintances, I woke up and he had written a review of the record on his Facebook page. I don't know this guy to ever write. He's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">a kind of conventional, kind of square, really good guy, but you know. It was so sweet and so like honest and just how much he loves the record and has giving these, you know it's not even my kind of genre really, but he's like, it's so good. So instead of just savoring that, you know like again, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">immediately got kind of caught up in I want more of that and how do I get more people to write. Do you know what I mean? Instead of just enjoying it, this guy went out of his way to \u2013 it's like my mind is constantly \u2013 you know? I'm definitely not savoring is all I'm trying to say. And not only that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200433\">I'm already way ahead. I'm getting way ahead of myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100028\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Like you \u2013 there's not this basic take in what's really there (unclear) and that is there.  It's [ameliorable] (ph) what more \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. And the thing is it's \u2013 look at the kickstarter thing. It's as if that's ancient history. Do you know what I mean? Whatever, $5,000. That's you know, that's not a good way to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">(Pause): [00:09:05 00:09:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: But it's hard because it is an old thing and that's the problem. It's like I know intellectually, but there's all this old stuff that's like finally we're back to \u2013 but the problem is I'm not 17. So because of that I think there's like this rush to feel like I've got to get things done fast <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">and that's a harder thing to \u2013 it's hard not to let that make you feel very, very stressed and anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Not to mention that even at 15 while you may have been incredibly prolific and then weren't for a period, even then you still didn't have this foundation of recognition from your own \u2013 from your mother, where you just had that inside you and then could write. Because you wanted to write or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">create or play music because you wanted to, but even still there may have been a driven-ness to get seen or known, going on even then about what was missing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Did your dad \u2013 you're always talking about your mother in this realm, did he understand what an artist you were?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Not really. I mean if he did he died before I could really find out, you know. I just know that he didn't really discourage me. He never discouraged me from writing. So, I don't know. That's something I'll just never really know about how he felt. He never told me to stop playing. He never told <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">me to be quiet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: He never \u2013 you know. He didn't tell you to be a dentist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: No. He didn't tell me to be anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Not even what he was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I was just thinking about that. Yeah, he never told me like, let me teach you about cars. But their whole family is like that. My dad's side is very unusual that way. They just really don't \u2013 they're just very unusual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Don't what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: There's no like be this, be that. They're just very, you know. Just be, like just be here, let's just be together, enjoy. They're very happy, I won't say happy-go-lucky, but kind of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">(Pause): [00:12:03 00:12:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: I mean these are all very hard \u2013 I mean my uncle, my dad's older brother, I mean the guy worked like crazy shifts at an auto plant. They lived in fucking \u2013 it was a shitty place but it just \u2013 it's not that everything was perfect. They had issues, but there was something like just kind of just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">yeah, there wasn't that intense like, what are we doing, or how do we get a better house, and why do I have this shitty job and other people have all this money, and they don't have that for some reason. They don't have that gene.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100028\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">(Pause): [00:12:49 00:13:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: I think another big thing, too, was I got a \u2013 it's definitely more so than any other recent time it's become much more like schematic or whatever, I'm very focused on like \u2013 so I got to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Like you grab your chest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, like I always feel tight here, you know, I feel like I'm tight, like I want to wake up but I'm like all kind of wacky and I don't want to get into that place, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">(Pause): [00:13:48 00:13:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: I think all of that is partly, probably at some level I'm super worried that like it's kind of like other times when everything's so great, something bad's going to happen to me. You know what I mean? Or, yeah, it's all combined like I'm not used to what's going on so I feel just you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">(Pause): [00:14:13 00:14:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: A sense of fear that something bad is going to happen in the future could be, in a way, actually the fear that something bad has happened already and did; that just places itself out as anticipating rather than \u2013 in a way for example in this process where you've been and things are going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">so well and changing for the better so quickly on the one hand is great. It's real. It's really happening. But on the other hand also is sort of like what's \u2013 so what's still there? You know, that even while they're going so well all this stuff in the past that didn't and you have feelings about, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200732\">the kinds of things what will be there waiting for you is this kind of calmed (unclear) right now.  It's good and it's there and it's real, but if it weren't as racy what's going to come up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: It's also the fear that I worry that I'm just going to be like this now. Do you know what I mean? Now that everything's going pretty well, you know, that I'm just going to be in this state of high anxiety all the time and feel, you know what I mean? And that's the thing about anxiety, it's always <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">a vicious cycle. It just feeds on itself, what's so hard about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">(Pause): [00:16:04 00:16:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: It feels like there is so much more we have yet to get to know about it is even. I do feel very hopeful that what you are feeling right now once we understand it will not feel this way to this intensity one day and that there will be more that will settle out the things that are stirring <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">right now even in doing well, that what it means to be doing well could have so many layers of meaning. Like for example your surpassing your father, you know, or your forgetting your father. Your father really being dead if you've moved on. And these are just \u2013 it could be \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. The same with my mom, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Exactly. How much you've held for the family, hopes and dreams and fantasies. I mean you've been this repository for so much in your history and your family that there's a lot riding and that could get straight even when you're doing well that I think we have yet to kind of unpeel all of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">the layers of what that means even.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I have thought, not in that way, I think it's the flip side of the same coin but I have been thinking that maybe part of it too is that just like the record's out in the world and my book like for the first time which I didn't feel this way with the book but I think because of all the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">work I've been doing here and stuff, like now I feel like I'm out in the world. Do you know what I mean? Like I feel like yeah, I whatever, I live in the same house, my family's all around here, whatever, but now I feel \u2013 something feels unmoored like I feel like, yeah, I will probably at some point <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F2\">play a show somewhere far away or I will \u2013 like I can tell, you know what I mean? I can taste certain things and that's I think scary, unsettling, because I think it also connects to, like wow, because then I'd feel like \u2013 not that I'm completely alone but I am. It's as if I'm \u2013 I don't know how to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F3\">explain it, you know, I'm completely cut from the fucking shitty umbilical cord to my family that \u2013 and I have no brothers and sisters and like I am, this is it \u2013 I am living my life and my life is me which is you know \u2013 there's all this stuff, do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100028\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: I totally hear you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Like I'm embracing these things really as careers now, I'm doing things seriously. Things are going relatively, you know, pretty well, you know \u2013 hopefully will continue and my mom's getting older. Do you know what I mean? Maybe there's something going on there, too. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: So you're saying it's related to what I have been saying that there is something, if you're just leading your own life at last and sort of just doing it, it is liking cutting a cord to the ties that kept you \u2013 they probably kept you feeling safe in a way that you at least had that foundation <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200851\">and the foundation came with so many strings attached. To cut them is terribly like letting loose and then where you land.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's a big part of it. I just feel. It's both liberating and terrifying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">(Pause): [00:19:57 00:20:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Because yeah, it's something that other people experience in their 20's. Some people made that cut in that more, very American kind of, you go off to college and that's it. You can't look back at the house or I don't know, whatever. They really kind of separate themselves you know? And I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B1\">\u2013 for me it is complicated because I do love my family, like I do feel like I do have something special other people don't have. But, it did come with a heavy price that was really shitty. So now it's like it's just like reconnecting with that 17, 18 year old. It's also reconnecting with the person <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B2\">I would have been in college and then left home and then moved or whatever people do. I don't know if that makes sense completely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">(Pause): [00:21:18 00:21:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Also, just to put it another way, even an idea of other people who cut that when they're 18 and go off to college or whatever, even when that's actually happened in the physical separation in a different way, a lot of people remain still unconsciously tied. They're still \u2013 (cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. Yeah I was thinking about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: They wanted to be a doctor because that's what their parents wanted them to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: I think you're actually talking about the kind \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: It's a psychological bind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Whatever.

I've traveled. It doesn't matter. Yeah. Yeah and I guess that's a good point. In a way I've been putting myself down by saying, other people, they can move wherever the fuck they want but they still have psychological baggage and fucked up things that they <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">can't get away from.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100028\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: And sometimes never do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, no. Yeah. That is one thing I'm very well \u2013 that's not something I take granted. I know how far I've come and how awesome I'm doing overall, like that I have no doubt about. Because all I've got to do is hang out with your friends and you see all the stuff people are dealing with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">or not dealing with. I think in a way that's what it is. Like even all this stuff is really good. It's all healthy. I think it's a healthy thing that's happening. It's just so shockingly new and kind of like just scary and also it gives me a lot of energy but I kind of don't know what to do with that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A52\">energy like I feel constantly amped. And that's a good thing but it's also like you said, you've got to be able to say okay, I've worked on this for many hours, now I'm going to just chill out and I'll get back to it tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">(Pause): [00:23:44 00:23:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: I do think you're bringing up though today something is being on top of it, just blanketly good and that you're just getting used to that. The idea of it is both liberating and terrifying to let go of one's internal objects, is a kind of death of the mother and father who live inside you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Let me give you an example. Like if I look at my everyday \u2013 I mean I'm only thinking of this now but it's kind of blowing me away now, I have been noticing that wow that's weird, I don't go to my cousin's house. I don't \u2013 I've really kind of cut myself off. I don't keep in touch with people. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB1\">My cousins live right down the street. My godson. For some reason I'm just kind of done. It's not that I don't miss people, I just \u2013 I don't know how to explain it. I think it's like I feel like, you know what? That was many, many years of being up each other's butts all the time and that was great <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB2\">in many respects but I'm just kind of done. You know, I'm just \u2013 but I think I haven't processed what that means. It's not like, okay, now I'm done. Like that many years of being so tight and literally spending so much time together, it's a little odd now. So I think it brings up a lot of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">(Pause): [00:25:14 00:25:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: It could bring on terror of \u2013 okay you're done on one hand but you've got to be done separating and being alone again and I just keep thinking that there are feelings that might as a child's and what would talk about this as a time alone that every person spends falling asleep in bed at night <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">that was terrifying for you. Yeah. And in a way your family does that kind of togetherness and what happens to your center, what comes to your mind? The terror must (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: What haunts you in that when things calm down, what does alone feel like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">(Pause): [00:26:17 00:26:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Or, why had alone come to feel so bad? CLIENT: Right. Well, that's the thing. In some ways, existential alone feels bad, but that's the thing, the other alone \u2013 the everyday alone has been feeling good. I enjoy it. I like to come home and just \u2013 so I think some of it is yeah, they're like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">two different kinds. There's the everyday that makes you very content and happy with \u2013 but yeah, I think it's the bigger, it's the more like, you know.

And the way I can tell is through the change in my interactions with other people. Do you know what I mean? Like with a friend I was saying about the writing, you know, like just the way I feel among other people now is so different that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B91\">I can just tell that whatever's happening as much as I might be freaking out, it's super healthy. Even on Monday night I went to the bar. I know these like bartender type people and whatever and this guy, and this other guy, were \u2013 they're good acquaintances, they had a D.J. there like one Monday out <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B92\">of the month. That's kind of fun. And I kind of \u2013 it's Monday night so I kind of like to blow it off but so I went and I went alone which I didn't want to do and it was cool. Like I didn't feel uncomfortable, not that I would have before but I would have felt a little \u2013 we're friends but we're not \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B93\">so I'd feel weird if I was still, like am I supposed to hang out with them? But we're just going to \u2013 I just didn't care. I had a beer. I saw plenty of kind of acquaintance type people, said hi, chit-chatted. It was fine and I just walked around and said hi to this person and went over there and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B94\">came back and talked some more but like before I was leaving I went over and just sat next to them while they were spinning and I didn't feel weird. I just hung out for a little bit. And then it was like all right guys, I'm going to take off and it was totally fine. Dave was like, how you been, man? <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B95\">What's going on? Like, in the past I would have been weird about that. Like, what am I, you know? Am I trying to make these people my friends or like, do you know what I mean? They're happy to see me. It was like, AP's here, all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Probably excited you came?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know? Again, instead of old, I would have brought all this old stuff, like are they really paying enough attention to me? Do you know what I mean? Like, those people are their real friends. That's their real crew. I'm just kind of like tagging along. Like I would have \u2013 just ridiculous. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD1\">Like, who the fuck cares. I'm just here to say hi. They're happy to see me. I had a couple of beers and I'm going home. It's pretty simple. So things like that are feeling way, way, way, way, way better to the point where in the moment I'm not thinking about this stuff anymore. Or like going to a party <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD2\">with Kelly. I just didn't care who was there and like I didn't know anybody there. Who the fuck cares? And I was totally fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: This is what you're describing about how it can be both liberating and terrifying to move from a place of feeling kind of paranoid and retreat into the world is looking at me and it's all \u2013 like it reflects on me \u2013 into a place of knowing, no they're not. Really, they're not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">THERAPIST: All of a sudden you get to not care. And they're not looking which is as kind of like, I'm alone, and that person's over there doing the same thing alone and that person's over there doing the same thing. That's the terrifying of the \u2013 in the paranoid place you can still feel like there's <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C31\">a world around you. This place gets depressing in an odd way, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100028\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C5\">CLIENT: Well it's both and that's the crazy thing.

I wonder if sometimes that's what happens with this, like I just feel, you know what I mean? Maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD1\">it's just like emotion that's kind of bubbling like trying to get out or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">THERAPIST: It sounds like there's a lot of feeling there.

I mean, it's interesting \u2013 I mean it's not just interesting, psychoanalysis \u2013 you know, there must be in psychoanalysis certain things, like certain markers or certain whatever.

Melanie Klein. Who really thinks about the process of analysis as waking up the patient's capacity to dream as a focus and the idea being that there can be at the beginning of this process, pockets of deadness inside where things are not knowable and dreamable and creatable yet. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E71\">And I think you're in this place where there are links being made so that things are coming alive and get to be known even \u2013 I don't even mean consciously, but in dreaming as the place to begin to process and have emotional experience, begin to have images and begin to have words for all this stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E72\">that's been stuck inside without words for so long and yet in that process it doesn't mean everything's hunky-dory because to begin to dream for example, there are vivid images. There's terrifying things in dreams. There are crazy and strange things in dreams. And I mean dreams as you know, mostly like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E73\">fantasies or night dreams also, but as things come alive there's \u2013 it's scary. It can be scary. Like what is there of life inside? And I think that's \u2013 a lot of that is happening right now. CLIENT: I do think of it like waking up. It definitely is, like that's what I was saying, it's kind of like being <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E74\">renanimated after being frozen like, sort of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: That's why I think about this theorist, because he describes it as literally you cannot wake up.

Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: It's not a crutch, it's just like it is like going to the gym, or whatever.
