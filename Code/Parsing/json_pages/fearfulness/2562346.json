I don\u2019t know whether it was a gambit or what. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">think both of us are making an effort to, you know, to just kind of get through the conflict, but I feel very frustrated -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: You mean she (inaudible at 0:01:17).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: (pause) I don\u2019t really know; I have some ideas about why she\u2019s being so stubborn, but I find it very frustrating. Last night, (sigh) I had a bit of a tantrum; I got angry at her, and I was having a very difficult time, by [contrast, I took to my exact words.] (ph) Ultimately, I apologized, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">guess because I was so [very articulate] (ph) (laughter) (pause) (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">It was interesting though, but I guess the experience of it was interesting in a sense that it was kind of free-floating anger, and it wasn\u2019t provoked by anything in particular. In fact, back to, you know, your proposition with regard to the jealousy, it was provoked by her saying, \u201cWell, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">before we go to bed, I need read this article that I\u2019m talking about, called [It Sucks Today, on the Canine] (ph) (inaudible at 0:02:53).\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">And it occurred to me that, you know, some of the resentment that I feel is definitely a very close proximity toward something very much like \u2013 like envy; something that she refuses to be sensitive to, and in fact has been remarkably, if not deliberately at some level, insensitive to. (pause) [0:03:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">So, I think that was probably at some level, what set me off, and that\u2019s a problem, or at the very least, it\u2019s interesting, but it\u2019s also a problem. I don\u2019t like it, you know, I think that there are enough substantive issues that we need to hash through without having our interaction complicated by such outbursts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">I do also think at some level, that our conversations are productive of such outbursts, in a sense that, you know, if I\u2019m working through something, Jennie is the most likely person for me to try it out on. And (sigh) that was another thing that came up in the conversation; tomorrow, she\u2019s \u2013 this wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">a surprise; it wasn\u2019t the first time. But she\u2019s very negative about our sessions and their, you know, potential for having a productive impact. And this doubt, yes -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Jennie is very negative [overlapping conversation at 0:04:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, basically unsupportive of this, feeling like it\u2019s not very useful. And in general, you know, has been taking a line that she takes it herself, almost invariably to interment, which is just something that\u2019s impeding, either it\u2019s completely unfixable or you have to suck it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: You know, and when she\u2019s being more reflective or something like that. But right now, the battle lines are drawing a little bit. It\u2019s not so bleak as all that, I mean, I think we\u2019re managing to navigate in a larger sense. But it\u2019s very much like me, to feel the need to mitigate by saying that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">[0:05:42] But I do think that that negativity and that lack of supportiveness is probably something to keep in mind. I\u2019m not sure what it means; either for our interaction, or for \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how it affects our interaction on the one hand, and I\u2019m not sure how much that external impediment is something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">that we need to be sensitive to. But there it is, and that came out very clearly.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562346\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">It also came up very clearly that I had \u2013 I was completely incompetent to kind of summarize where I think we had gotten; just very concisely. I feel apparently some \u2013 maybe just anticipating that she\u2019s of certain risk in this (experiment) (ph). But I had a hard time (particularly) (ph). (pause) [0:06:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: I thought, are you asking me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: No, I was just reflecting on a couple of things that have happened [overlapping conversation at 0:07:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: No, that\u2019s fine, I just wasn\u2019t sure -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Oh, am I asking you what you think the significance of Jennie being -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: No, no, to summarize where we\u2019ve gotten.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Oh, am I asking you to summarize where we\u2019ve gotten? No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean think I can (preventing) (ph) talking about it, which just interestingly, you know, in the moment while I was really very articulate about what I was angry about, I found it much more difficult, so to speak, to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">remember what our conversations would look like. I felt disconnected in a way that I sometimes do. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">I mean, and I remember having a fleeting thought; you know, maybe tomorrow I can talk to Marshall and tell her what we\u2019re up to. (laughter) Which I think is direct analogue of the moments when I\u2019d ask you to summarize what we\u2019re up to. [0:08:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: (chuckle) I got you. All right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Sorry, these thoughts are just sort of piling on. One of the interesting things I guess, about the way that structurally, it is formulated in that setting, is that whereas, at least at one moment in the last couple of weeks, I had great (pause) I have felt significant caution about calling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">our interactions work. They\u2019re, you know, in this other setting, it\u2019s kind of, (chuckle) you know, since September, I haven\u2019t been (chuckle) doing much other work; I\u2019ve been taking care of Grayson. So to the extent that I have an independent existence outside the household, there is an investment in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">our conversations that there, I\u2019m very eager and eager to claim. Whereas in our \u2013 at least one of our previous conversations, I felt very shy of claiming it in the usual and familiar way. [0:09:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Sorry, I\u2019m losing you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: So, I remember a couple of weeks ago, you know, I said you had called our \u2013 spoken of our work together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: And I had felt very kind of queasy about that, for reasons that might just be an advergence of psycho babble, but probably I thought had at least genealogical relationship to the infamous overheard conversation around some stairs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: In this setting where, you know, where Jennie had gone, it was not really for mediation, but for help, you know, in trying to figure out how to relate to each other better. But it was very clear to me that I was quite invested in claiming exactly the same interaction as significant work that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">I was doing, and felt quite upset and hurt to hear Jennie be so negative and dismissive of it. [0:11:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: And yet, I was disconnected enough that I couldn\u2019t describe it very well. In a way that she\u2019d remarked on several times was quite prominent when I would talk about work that I was doing in Egypt.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562346\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: That you had a -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: I had a hard time formulating, you know, telling people [a bit those kind of things on boys,] (ph) and it felt like the experience of it felt similar somehow in that setting to trying to find it, being invested in it in some very strong and significant way; trying to find it and not being <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">about to find it, and not being able to \u2013 you know, when something is connected to it, I\u2019m very fluent and articulate. And when I\u2019m not connected to it, you know, potentially, it can go in one or two directions; either I can become extremely verbose and kind of involuted in my description, or I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200492\">can\u2019t call the words to mind. [0:12:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">And it seems to me in reflecting on that particular moment in our exchange with tomorrow, that the energy, or cognition or what have you is similar; that seemed interesting. It\u2019s like work, but not work, or I\u2019m not doing it well, or isn\u2019t appropriate, or you know, there\u2019s another will, or desire that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">diverts me. I don\u2019t know; undermines my connection to it. But the bottom line is that I\u2019m not sufficiently connected to it to have a kind of cognitive picture of it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m (startled) (ph) by it being like under attack. [0:13:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: And wondering if that has something to do with the difficulty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Possibly. You would think, you know, if it\u2019s not reliable, if I don\u2019t secure in it, I don\u2019t know. But that does seem common to some degree. (pause) [0:14:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">I\u2019m sorry, [overlapping conversation at 0:15:12]. One thinking into my head, I think progressively over the last couple of days, is that it was very clear in my mind as I was walk\/running over here, and it\u2019s apropos of nothing in particular, I guess at some level, but on the other hand, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">been talking about for the last two weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">I had a very clear formulation of why I might be so reluctant to look for work; like the precise mechanism leading from anger at Jennie to reluctance to look for work. As unsightly as that might be, given our family situation, you know, I mean at some level I feel anguished, and ashamed, and it\u2019s terrible <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">that I\u2019m so without executive function that I cannot frame this off. But I know, I feel even in thinking about it myself, I feel the need not to legitimate it, but I think is about as close as I\u2019ve come to kind of understanding it, with that preamble. [0:16:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">I don\u2019t \u2013 I feel as if she was so offensive and dismissive in the way that she presented these things, that if I were to say, \u201cOkay fine.\u201d I would ratify this in our relationship. It would be a precedent; it would involve continuous acceptance of a really terrible way of interacting. And I just, I find <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">myself unwilling to say, \u201cOkay, well you\u2019re right.\u201d I feel as if she would, you know, feel \u2013 take a sense of again, legitimation from it. I feel like we\u2019re in a crisis of legitimacy, and the precedent for our relationship would just be devastating. [0:17:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">That is the intuition, as a rationalization I guess, is probably more precise of the intuition that seems to be underlying my difficulty. Now the next question becomes, why it was difficult for me before this particular conflict erupted. You know, this dynamic of me not looking for a job has been operative <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">for most of our relationship, and then before I was with Jennie I still had exactly the same problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562346\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">So there\u2019s something far more complex there, and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Well, I\u2019m not so sure, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: I mean, in the (inaudible at 0:18:24) we talked about when you\u2019ve been at work, it\u2019s I think pretty similar, where you fail like to work while you\u2019re being treated the way that you are, I imagine would sort of similarly gratify -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Perhaps; perhaps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: or legitimate the bad treatment, by the (invisual) (ph) institution -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: So the complexity, I mean that\u2019s, you know, a rationalization of something that historically at least, I\u2019ve had a hard time getting in touch with, and I think with the help of our psychotherapy here, I\u2019m getting better at it, or at least it\u2019s getting \u2013 the lag time is getting shorter. [0:19:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">But one complexity or uncertainty; perennial uncertainty, is whether in fact this analysis is true; whether I\u2019m actually good at evaluating a relationship in which I\u2019m being devalued and disrespected. Or whether this, you know, I mean I think the way that I would translate Jennie\u2019s incomprehension, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">if I were Jennie, is to say, \u201cWell, of course I\u2019m not disrespecting you, and I\u2019m not devaluing you, and I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re getting that from.\u201d I think that\u2019s the point of incomprehension.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">You know, so there\u2019s this premise on my part that she\u2019s really being disrespectful, and dismissive, and there\u2019s this premise on her part that that is not the case at all. And I would hazard to guess that this dynamic, with necessary adjustments being made, is probably not uncommon in instances where <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">this obstruction of the will is \u2013 it\u2019s in prominent in my life. [0:20:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you\u2019re being terribly insulted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, so that\u2019s always like the problem that I have, and acting on it, or in pursuing it, or evaluating it, is that I never know whether I\u2019m being paranoid, then with our new vocabulary, whether I\u2019m feeling disconnected, or whether there really is kind of dismissive core to the relationship; <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">a disrespectful core to the relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: And that is partly because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: So sensitized to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You feel so strongly disrespected, that that becomes, you know strongly being disrespected.

And you\u2019re saying that based on your experience, you would have thought that simply being able to articulate it, would involve somehow a capacity to engage in this higher level executive functioning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">Whereas it can, suggesting among other things perhaps, that\u2019s what\u2019s really the verbalization, because the verbalization is not as effective as it might be, you know, a model in which whatever this mechanism might be, it\u2019s preverbal seems more persuasive relatively speaking.

(pause) Let\u2019s say there\u2019s in addition to the insult, because of the insult, which we\u2019re pretty clear about, some very strongly felt, very sort of primitive feeling of abandonment; I\u2019m making this up \u2013 that was also implicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: But haven\u2019t we already explicitly established that this is the case? That this is part of the case? I think, I mean even our model of connectedness, you know, implies me abandoning you before you abandoning me. And you for quite a while, I think, were very keen on this particular element of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">the model. So, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m a little suspicious.

In a way, that\u2019s sort of sidebar to what we were talking about a minute ago, in that it just occurred to me that like that\u2019s actually the most recent example I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t under \u2013 I mean abandonment in a sense of her not being supportive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m mixing things up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m getting lost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Okay. There\u2019s a modularly question, which I sort of was going to bring up this (chuckle) oh, hypothetical example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: (chuckle) Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Although, we can do that (inaudible at 0:29:19).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: And then, there\u2019s a separate thing I\u2019m bringing up, which is maybe already obvious to you; that in the example we keep referring back to as the most recent one, which has happened between you and Jennie was the one that you were describing to Elizabeth, that you were really angry about. Where <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">you felt very betrayed, and how she was about you taking the time to write.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: So I\u2019m saying actually, that\u2019s not the most recent example. (inaudible at 0:30:00) The most recent example is the one you\u2019re telling me about on Tuesday, that happened in Elizabeth\u2019s office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Right. Okay, I got it. Yeah, well I mean you know, I brought it up, because I thought it would be good fodder for -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Right, I\u2019m just saying it had clearly; maybe it was just obvious to you, like how that is the exactly the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, totally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Where you know, she \u2013 you felt (open) (ph) and betrayed, and then you become inarticulate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: About the thing itself. Not inarticulate generically, you know, I didn\u2019t have difficulty interacting or whatever. It was just that this thing suddenly became opaque.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Right. In the same way that we assume that some of your difficulty getting applications done had to do with the betrayal and the insult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes. And, you know, I mean getting the applications done is also something about describing work, and it involves precisely the same operation; it\u2019s not just some generic function.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a really good point. It\u2019s not \u2013 yeah, right; it\u2019s not writing down your demographics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I mean it\u2019s not like just some sort of value free thing, it involves [overlapping conversation at 0:31:23] Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: In fact, lousy things happened at work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right. And you know, what is difficult for me about Jennie\u2018s stubbornness and obstreperousness this interaction; this conflict is among other things, that she\u2019s very unsympathetic at this point, for reasons that I frankly understand. You know, they have to do with just being genuinely <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">concerned about our finances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Very unsympathetic to the difficulty that\u2019s applied by making these applications. So what I was unable to describe to her in Tomorrow\u2019s office, and had just sort of given up on trying to describe to her at home, is precisely what I would have hoped that she would be supportive of. (pause) [0:32:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562346\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">So it\u2019s like I can\u2019t ask at some level, this, whatever this is, prevents me from asking for the thing that I want, explicitly. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Being, you had trouble saying, \u201cHey, you know how hard this is for me. I\u2019m doing everything I can think to do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: \u201cAnd I need two things.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: No, there is a kind of (recurtisin) (ph) here, I guess; I guess I\u2019m observing, you know, in a sense that the process of trying to engage with Jennie to short-circuit the blockage that comes about on account of my anger, and my fear of abandonment, and whatever the modelary characteristics may <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB1\">be; that process is a prerequisite presumably, for her actually giving her support. [0:33:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">In other words, being able to articulate that is necessary if, you know, I\u2019m going to have a partner who knows what she\u2019s supporting. And so if I can\u2019t really describe to her the process, let alone what I\u2019m trying to do to address it, so that it doesn\u2019t seem just like some congenital defect, then, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">I\u2019m unable to do so, because of whatever is intervening, then I have a real problem. It\u2019s a vicious cycle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Isn\u2019t that a little like the applications themselves -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah, as I say, it\u2019s recursive; it exists at every level of the (practical) (ph). [0:34:45] (pause) I\u2019m guessing that longstanding, you know, psychological things like this often take this form. That seems quite characteristic of something that is just a longstanding issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, absolutely. But I guess I want to make sure the specificity I had in mind was clear; it probably was. But in case it wasn\u2019t, in order to explain to Jennie what you want from her, you have to refer to all this, this sort of history of insult, and shame and difficulty. [0:35:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: Well, probably that too, but I was thinking, in order to explain to Jennie this, I have to explain to her, you know, what actually is impeding me from doing the applications. Meaning both how I\u2019m upset with her; I was pretty good at that actually, although she was not very good at listening to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">But also what it is that I think is going on with the applications; what exactly the interference is; why it\u2019s not so simple as saying, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll sit down and do them.\u201d Apparently. Now as we\u2019ve discerned, there\u2019s a component; an interpersonal component of this. And that\u2019s the part about me being <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F71\">mad at Jennie I guess, or being afraid of Jennie abandoning me, or some interaction of the two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">There\u2019s also the kind of, the behavioral component. So one of them is the relational component of it. The other is the behavioral component of it. I guess what I would\u2019ve liked to say, is that we\u2019re working on both of them, you know, and this is what the implications of the behavioral component are. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F91\">This is what I\u2019m asking for support with. And I have a hard time doing that, apparently, because I\u2019m feeling disconnected from Jennie and feeling a fear of abandonment, and\/or a sense of anger and so on. [0:37:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">So, there\u2019s just this sort of very complex tangle of vicious circles that are making it very difficult at this point, for me and us, as a couple in the household, to do what we are \u2013 a complete consensus needs to happen, which is why we need to have two incomes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Actually that\u2019s only one of the things that needs to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200FC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562346\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah, well the other thing that needs to happen is that Jennie needs to, you know, she must; she must as far as I can see, behave with more integrity, in both her support of me, and in our interactions; needs to follow through. The same way that I need to follow through. Not in the same way, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF1\">but you know, but both of us need to follow through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">You like every formulation, but the last formulation.

The reason I don\u2019t like the last formulation is because, there\u2019s something I don\u2019t like about equating your having trouble following through, and equating how she\u2019s having trouble following through, because (pause) you\u2019re the one who\u2019s dealing, like who\u2019s getting the short end of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201031\">stick, I think on both counts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">In other words, you\u2019re feeling shitty for not doing the applications, and because you feel like she\u2019s not being -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">CLIENT: Not just not doing the applications, I\u2019m feeling shitty for not having something to do in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">CLIENT: No, that\u2019s important. I mean it\u2019s not, you know \u2013 (pause) But you\u2019re saying that\u2019s the end of the stick \u2013 of the wedge? You\u2019re saying, first things first? [0:39:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: I guess that was what I had in mind, the most proximate thing, but maybe it isn\u2019t.
