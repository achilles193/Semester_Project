(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: [Good, thanks].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Were you okay during the whole thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I was fine. Thank you for asking. And you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of (pause) scary because my mom lives in Cheshire. Like two blocks away from her was where the it all happened, and so she saw like all the police cars and heard gunshots and stuff. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">I think for me I feel like the scary stuff is about to happen here. (chuckles) (pause) At the airport and stuff, you know, going through security, like all that. [inaudible at 00:04:57] is going to take place afterwards. Islamaphobia and like (chuckles) \"immigrants are bad\" or whatever. People are already, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">you know, talking like that. (pause) I kind of feel you know, I feel bad for that kid because he was just a kid. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">But I know people have died and got injured. (pause) People don't really understand or want to understand their situations, you know? (pause) A part of why I feel trapped in relationships and things is because I feel trapped because of like nationality and citizenship. (chuckles) Like I was brought <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">to the US in my teenage and I felt like I didn't have a choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">Like I felt like I didn't want to come because, you know, I was 15. I was just about to go off to college in Nepal and I had friends there, so leaving them behind was sad and I didn't want to do it. You know, America was this big scary place and I didn't know anything about it. And then they came here <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">and did not it was not how I expected, right? (chuckles) I had to work, and I had to give up stuff, and I had no friends and no one to talk to. It was very, very, very isolating, you know? I hated it. (laughter) And I couldn't say that to anyone. I couldn't like express this angst with anyone for years. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">I felt like why did my dad do this out of his own greed? But they said \"Oh, it's for you so you'll have a better life in the future, better opportunities.\" And I'm not like trying to deny any of that. Thousands and thousands of people want to come to the US for exactly those reasons, so they must be <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">valid, you know? (chuckles) But I feel like all those people don't have psychological problems like my dad did, you know. (chuckles) They work hard and they stay close to their communities. At least that's what I gather from immigrant literature that I've read and people I've talked to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">I feel like their experience is far less isolating than ours was. (chuckles) (pause) And I feel trapped (laughter) thinking that. (pause) Not being able to, you know, get out or say anything. (pause) But I have seen a lot of positive things here, and I really want to like hold onto those and like turn <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">this whole narrative around, you know. The narrative in my head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">I don't know. It's so weird. (chuckles) Like I think my mom wouldn't have been able to leave my dad if we weren't in the US. Like she wouldn't have been able to leave him in Nepal. So that's good and liberating. But it's so depressing and like so caustic and isolating. Like in Nepal, we had community <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">and you're scared of the community because I guess my mom was more scared. I wasn't scared, you know. Like she was scared that they'd judge her and won't let her break her marriage. But I think that was only her in-laws, but how do I know? I was only a child. So now she doesn't want to go back to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200332\">Nepal, but I do. I want to keep visiting and to me it's a place of, you know, a lot of beauty and people and community.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559534\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">I always want to go and visit but she doesn't. But then yeah, so it's a positive thing that she left him here but then, you know, she didn't have anything to replace him with, you know? Like she's still struggling, she's still having to make her career and she's still at the starting gate, you know? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">(chuckles) Like some of her colleagues are, you know, 20-year-olds who've done it right. Gotten their Bachelor's and now they're working on their Master's and they're going to teach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">So yeah, I feel like it's mixed, you know, and I'm very, very scared of like (pause) Yeah, I just feel scared when I think of the US. (chuckles) It's given us things but it's also taken a lot away, I feel like. (chuckles) (pause) I don't completely feel positive about it. (pause) And it's not something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">you can say to anyone. (chuckles) I guess people ask \"Oh, do you like the US better than Nepal?\" Then you can say what places have their advantages. It's kind of understood but it's not really like you're still going through it and you still have emotions that you can't really express. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">I guess people like Chris [ph], they might feel the same way. They feel lonely here in the US, but they can't spend too much time thinking about it because they can't deal with the emotions. Then there's other people who only see opportunity here and they, you know, spend a lot of time just pursuing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">those and pursuing all of the things you get here and not worry about those that you don't. I don't know. Like I get all that and I know like yeah, I'm supposed to do that. Like in the US, I have more freedom and I should just focus on that and when I'm here, just do those things that I cannot do in Nepal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">But then I think of my past and I get really sad. You know, like how we were trapped and I keep thinking about that. It's like torture (chuckles) and I don't know why I do that. I should just not do it. (pause) It's very scary and if I I mean, consciously if I don't do it, in my subconscious I still <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">kind of it's there. I don't know what that means in psychological terms [if I'm having doubt with it] or whatever. Like yesterday, we were doing a vigil at the square two blocks away and I was supposed to go and I went. But the previous night I had a dream that I think I just realized on my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">page that my wall was not private. I mean, it was open to public.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">I have no idea how, when it's been, and that freaked me out. (chuckles) So I thought, oh my gosh, my dad is going to know where I am. So I had a dream that he tracked me down, and at the vigil he was there and he like bombed the place. (laughter) And I was so scared I didn't I was like, I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">want to go to this, he's going to be there. So I dreamed about what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry, go on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: No, I dream about him coming back and it scares me. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559534\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: In the dream, he bombed the place or you were worried he would?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: I don't know. I can't remember very specifically, but I just felt like he was there to harm me. I don't know specifically what it was, that he just did something that harmed me. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">I'm not sure what exactly that meant. (pause) I mean, how he did it. (long pause) I guess I don't know. That feels like a trap. I mean, isn't it? I'm trapped with the same kind of emotions from my dad and I haven't been able to move on. I don't know. Maybe it doesn't mean that. I'm just wondering <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">if that's what it means. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">But to me, it just means that I'm afraid still, you know. (chuckles) I'm afraid of him. (pause) I don't know if it will go away. I don't know if it goes away in people, [like these feelings].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well, clearly there's some association between him and the men who bombed the marathon, that he too would bomb. There's some association that he's a dangerous person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Capable of a very destructive act.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, he's always been like on the edge. Like he wasn't he hasn't he wouldn't hit me and stuff. I don't know if he actually how many other people -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">Well, so the association was that the elder brother was a boxer and my dad used to be a boxer in college. (pause) And later on in life he would say stuff like \"Yeah, I could be a hit man. I could get hired and I could do all those things.\" Like he didn't care. To me it sounded like he was trying to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">dissociate himself from his family. He never really wanted to be a family man. He always tried to like put my mom and I aside and try really hard to be free, you know. He did everything or he lived his life according to that principle that he was single somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: It sounds like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like he really sort of saw you guys as people he should come home to and take care of in any way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Oh, absolutely not. It was actually the opposite. That he felt like he hadn't married, he hadn't a child, and he lied about it from the beginning. Like he wasn't there for six years anyway and then when he came back, he again started having affairs and I guess a lot of men do that. I know (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">people sleep around and have affairs, but he would take it a few steps further, like he got really emotionally involved with this one student of his. She wanted to marry him and this and that, and she turned out to be a drama queen. So he took her to a different part of the country and he wanted to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D2\">marry her. My mom was like \"Yeah, I guess I'll step aside and you guys can do what you want.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">Apparently they got married. I don't know how legal that was. (pause) And I don't know what happened. That woman finally somehow got over him and left. But yeah, he would just go about pretending that we didn't exist, you know. Not only were we not his responsibility he never thought we were his <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">responsibility, but like he wasn't beholden to us or we weren't even related. (chuckles) The affairs he had in the US, one of them he said he lied and said he was divorced and he had like an 11-year-old daughter or a 9-year-old daughter, even though I was 18 or 19 at that point. (chuckles) (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200712\">I guess he too felt trapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559534\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Why do you think he kept coming back? Like when you were six, do you know why he came back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: [There are] theories or reasons, my mom says, but (pause) I think she was always willing to take him back. Like she always she hadn't cut that connection, you know. She hadn't emotionally disconnected from him. I don't know if they were legally married. I think they had legally separated <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">but still like, I mean, I guess he needed a family. I mean, we were his family on paper. I mean, biologically, I think. (chuckles) (pause) Why do you -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Because what you're saying, like he wanted to be single, he wanted to, you know, be free I mean, why come back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Mmmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I imagine there is a reason because he did. So I wasn't sure if I wasn't understanding something culturally or legally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: It's just not clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think there were any cultural or legal specificities, but I think he just failed. Like he didn't have a steady job and my mom was always there to take care of him so he came back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: I see. Do you think it was mostly that, somewhere to live and food?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: I think so. (pause) Yeah. (pause) I mean, yeah, what else because if those affairs didn't work out and then he was left in the cold I suppose. He didn't have it in him to make his own life, you know, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">I mean, that's why I'm trying to compare him to like all those comedy shows or stories. All these CEOs have secret families and all. (chuckles) So, I mean, that makes me think yeah, okay, people have affairs but then they also have jobs and they make money. But that's not the case in his case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Did he live off these other women when he was with [other women]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: I'm not sure. I'm not sure of the financial thing. (pause) Like the woman he quote-unquote married, he was teaching at this computer academy and she was a student. So then he was making for those few years, he had a job until the academy tanked. (chuckles) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">And here in the US, he didn't really have he had a steady job when we were all in a small town in Virginia, but then afterwards when I think it was patchy. I think he worked in a fast food restaurant once, but I don't think like the women took care of him financially. I don't think anyone did <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">that other than my mom. I'm not sure why he kept coming back. I might have to ask my mom now. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: What about your mom? What do you think was in it for her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: I think she loved him. She kept thinking she could change him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Into what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Into a more responsible guy. (chuckles) Yeah, I think she probably had a very, very specific list of demands. Like one, quit smoking; two, get a job; three (chuckles) You know, control your temper. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Do you think it bothered her that he was with other women?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: I'm sure, yeah. I'm sure it devastated her. Like she would stay up I think I was there [when I was actually] aware of something that must have been happening. Like he was at a bar or something or she said she kept calling, wanting him to come home, and I fell asleep at some point. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">came in the morning or something and he said \"Now, you know it's very hard. I have no job\" and this and that. \"I have to be the designated driver, that's what I was doing.\" So he was trying to guilt-trip us into thinking he was up to something other than completely selfless (chuckles) and public serving.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559534\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">But I don't know. You know, I could never trust him, so maybe he was doing that. (chuckles) I think at that point I believed him. (chuckles) (pause) Does this ever go away? Like if you come from a crappy family like is mine a crappy family? Would you agree? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: (chuckles) So does this ever go away, or am I going to keep talking about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: What's the \"this\"? Does \"this\"?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Well, maybe we should think about what you might want to know about what \"this\" is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Will I ever stop talking about it? Well, maybe not so much that, but me to keep getting affected by this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">And by that, I guess I mean not having those dreams or not like feeling afraid of him and like yeah, I don't know. Not being affected by the past. Like [inaudible at 00:27:44] would keep telling me \"Your past reflects in your present behavior, you should get therapy\" and this and that. So I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">how he could see that, he would be like \"Okay, we're not meeting\" and I would just go completely to pieces and say stuff to him like \"I have a fear of abandonment because when I was 10, my dad walked out on my mom.\" (chuckles) So that's what made him say \"Your past behavior your past reflects your <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B72\">present behavior.\" I guess that not happening too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I have a few thoughts a few questions, actually. My first question is, can you imagine that? Can you imagine a time where your past feels like it can dominate your experience?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah, like when I feel strong and when I'm feeling positive and when I feel like I can do stuff. I wouldn't say \"do anything.\" (chuckles) But do stuff, like work and get be successful and help people and be sensitive and articulate and all that. Yeah, just be positive and see that in people, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">that I did something good, then I feel like that cloud of my past is far away, you know. Even when I'm dealing with my mom and she doesn't seem miserable or anything, you know. When I feel like I can move forward and I have [inaudible at 00:29:25] and stuff, I don't see my past dominating me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: And so in asking me that, did you want affirmation about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: About what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Well, you said do I think that there could be a time where this won't dominate, and so I asked you and you said \"Yes, I actually do think so.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: So I'm wondering, and you're asking me, did you want affirmation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: I guess, yeah, I like the reminder that yes, it is possible. (chuckles) Or maybe just [correct my attitude a little bit] and say \"Well, there will be periods where you will feel down, and then you will find your path pulling you back.\" I don't know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: So what came to mind is both, both sides. One that I would not let you be too quote-unquote too hopeful, and the other side -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: to affirm that you can sort of overcome some of these fears.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: I feel like those moments really highlight the ways that you can feel very alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559534\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Because it seems like you feel sort of out there on your own with your own thoughts and fears, and you're looking for me to ground you somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) (pause) I guess grounded in the boundaries of human experience and like what other people have gone through (chuckles) so I don't feel so weird and alone, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: What came to my mind, not remembering much physics, is like when you ground an electrical charge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Mmmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: That's what came to my mind. Like you don't want to be too hopeful, but not too pessimistic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Grounded like an electrical charge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah, I suppose. (pause) Yeah. In a way I have this need to be grounded. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: That's interesting. (pause) I know this has come up at times throughout our work. Aside from the logistical parts, do you feel that coming an extra time, especially after Wednesday, a week for a while would be helpful to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: I think it would be. It's just for me, it's the financial -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Well, that's because finances are just logistical and certainly not just logistical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: But I wanted I always want to think about what's best for treatment and then figure the fees out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">THERAPIST: But I wanted to because I know I've brought it up, and I feel like we've never fully discussed it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">THERAPIST: And so to start with, it's helpful for me to know what you think would be ideal and take it from there. So has that been something that you've thought about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: Well, since there are logistical problems, I haven't thought about it too much. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: Maybe that's a problem in itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: Well, if you don't let yourself think about things because you imagine it's not possible, then what are all the things you're not allowing yourself to think about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: What? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that's two-pronged. One is, that might be a even if things aren't possible, there might be a lot of value in thinking about them, and you may also assume that things aren't possible that might be possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I try not to I don't know. (chuckles) It's funny. I feel like I have you and Chris [ph] and all these other people to like curb my enthusiasm all the time. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: What do you mean by that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">CLIENT: Well, this is where I feel like a child or like I don't feel like I can make my decisions and I feel alone and childish, I suppose. Like I wanted to go to Greece on my own and not with Chris [ph]. Or like go with him but do my own thing because I don't trust him to provide the right kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201131\">dynamic that I'm looking for. So I found this teaching gig where you stay there and teach English for two weeks, but that just kind of looks a bit dubious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">Like I asked the guy to send me e-mails of previous instructors and he said \"That's not possible right now.\" And Chris [ph] kept going \"This looks weird, this looks dubious.\" Then finally I'm like forget it, I'm not going to do it. So even though it might be legit, I have all these fears of it might <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201171\">be legit. Of course, you don't want to go to a country you've never been to before and live in a strange city with God knows who for two weeks. But you know, that's kind of like I keep going from possibility to trap to possibility to trap. Because that possibility now looks like a trap, you know? (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201172\">I'm in the middle of nowhere in a place I don't know, two weeks, okay, it feels like a trap. (chuckles) I just feel weird, you know, like my own thinking, I'm sure, makes possibilities turn into traps.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20116-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20116-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559534\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Do you think you could get trapped in therapy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: Hmmm.

(chuckles) But other you know, I don't feel trapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: Well, let me ask you this. How do you feel coming an extra time a week would be helpful to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">CLIENT: I don't know. Would we have enough to talk about? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">THERAPIST: That's not how it would be helpful to you. That's how you're skeptical it would be helpful to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. Would it be helpful? (chuckles) (pause) I don't know. What would it be like [to watch therapy]? (chuckles) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">Like how does it happen? How does like something you're feeling positive about turn into a trap? (pause) I don't know. (pause) I guess it happens with other people. (pause) At one point [inaudible at 00:36:56] liked me and then very quickly (chuckles) it turned into a trap he didn't like, and he just <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D1\">pushed as hard as he could. So it happens with other people. (chuckles) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like I mean, this is something I'm suggesting. I have thoughts about how it might be useful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">THERAPIST: But it sounds like it's not simply logistical. It's also you're not sure it's something that you want or you have thoughts about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess we have to do it if it was logistically possible. We can see how helpful it is. (chuckles) I cannot predict how it might be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">THERAPIST: Right. Well, there's the and that's even logistical, is it helpful. But your thoughts about it and worries or feelings about it are important too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">THERAPIST: On a very basic level, sort of the way I see what we're doing together is I mean, you have very ambitious and I mean that in a very good way -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\">THERAPIST: goals about what you want for yourself emotionally and in your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">THERAPIST: You want things to be different. You want your experience to be different. You want possibilities to be open. You want to be thinking and feeling about things differently than you have before. As you said, you know, is your past going to dominate your experience or can you change it. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201471\">you already have. I mean, you're already making great progress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">THERAPIST: But there's a lot to be done. And in general, when I see people who want to do this, I do think frequency helps more than -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014F\">THERAPIST: It's almost like when you learn a language. If you do an immersion program for six months, you're better off than taking it once a week for two years, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20151\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">THERAPIST: So it's not only the amount of sessions, it's the intensity and I do think the intensity can help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">THERAPIST: And that's the general idea I have. And you use this process beautifully, you really do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">THERAPIST: And I see that you use twice a week intensively, and I do think that could even sort of be deepened with three times a week.

Yeah, I mean, sure. (chuckles) I would welcome that experience then (chuckles) if you recommend it highly. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Then there's also the practical issues, and then there's your feelings about it and what it even means, which is part of it too. I mean, I'm definitely willing to you know, I think I mentioned I don't think it's a good idea to bill your insurance for a third session because I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201651\">they probably won't pay for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">THERAPIST: I'd rather just have the benefit from what they're covering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">THERAPIST: But obviously well, not obviously I'd offer you a very reduced fee for that third session a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">THERAPIST: It would be more than zero, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">THERAPIST: it would be a very reduced fee but I also appreciate, as we've been talking about, that finances are very tight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">CLIENT: Yeah, I wish I could do something about that but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Well, that's also what we're talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Sorry, what were you going to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: No, I just wanted to like give my work a few more months and not get a job just yet, you know? Like I'm not in a good place right now mentally or work-wise because I haven't worked on my project for 23 days now and that feels like so horrible. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">THERAPIST: So in your mind, being able to come a third time a week would mean sacrificing your craft somewhat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean, I'll have to see, like not just about the money issue but also like the (pause) Yeah. Because it's not like I come here and I forget what we talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">I make notes as soon as I get back, or mostly as soon as I get back, and then I try to think about it over the course of the week. So that takes time I think. I'm trying to be very realistic (chuckles) about it, which is new for me. So that takes time and I think it's one of my priorities actually as <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201891\">much as my work. I think it's basically on par with work right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">THERAPIST: It's such a complicated calculus because people go to therapy so they can live a fuller life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">THERAPIST: But you don't want to do so much therapy that it's impeding your living your life right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">THERAPIST: So it's an important calculus. I mean, the goal is hopefully not to have therapy happen all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">THERAPIST: In some ways maybe but in terms of working on things -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">CLIENT: Right. These are the two things I need to work on basically, like my work and therapy. Some people would say therapy is most important but for me, working is slightly more important just because it's what got me depressed and it's also my therapy in a way, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Well, and hopefully they're not in competition with each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, only when it's logistical like with money, it could be in conflict. And time-wise it could be [in conflict]. I don't think I mean, there are a bunch of other things that I'm doing which I feel like I can reduce. (chuckles) Like the stuff in the community, but then that also becomes <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F1\">some kind of a therapy.

So it's not a huge logistical piece, but it is a little piece that could be less money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BD\">CLIENT: Well, if they are paying more then they will definitely come back and realize their mistake at some point. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BF\">THERAPIST: I don't know if it's a mistake or if they raised their rates. I have no idea.

(chuckles) Sometimes they do. I think I once got a check by mistake and then they said \"Oh, don't cash it, don't cash it.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CF\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D1\">THERAPIST: Well, I'll look into that piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D3\">CLIENT: Okay. You can look into it (chuckles) and you can let me know how much it would be and (chuckles) I can see because I thought maybe I should live on my own, but even that might have to be put on hold. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D5\">THERAPIST: Because?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D7\">CLIENT: Money. (laughter) It's all money. It's like all tied up. Like if my mom finds a job, then I'll have my own money and then I can spend it. But if she doesn't find a job, then I have to stay with them unless I would find a job of my own which I don't right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Well, that's not true. That's true because I mean, you don't have to wait for your mom to find a job in order to live on your own. You don't have to give her money and she can worry about that herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">THERAPIST: You're not making that decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E3\">THERAPIST: That's still your decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E5\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's a decision. I shouldn't see it as a have-to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E7\">THERAPIST: Well, you feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E9\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's funny how my experience of things is very different than what is actually happening or might seem to a third person. (chuckles) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Well, in that way, if we go back to the idea of being trapped -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201ED\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EF\">THERAPIST: You make her your captor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F1\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F3\">THERAPIST: Well, in the sense that she you can't do anything without her doing something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F7\">CLIENT: I guess we're in a lock.
