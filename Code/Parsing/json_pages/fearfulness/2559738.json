Like I don\u2019t know like if I don\u2019t want to like talk about dealing with some things or if I want to meet less frequently for a while or what.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: With the, you know, of course always, or I just want to avoid dealing with myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Which is always an option.

And it\u2019s not like meeting frequently for some of that, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">I don\u2019t know. I guess it\u2019s because\u2026I think what I want is some relief from\u2026I just don\u2019t want to have to deal with or think about like difficult stuff, like\u2026like one of the things I hated about [inaudible \u2013 03:00] out was feeling like but I don\u2019t want to do this again. Like I don\u2019t know. I felt like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">but I\u2019ve already talked about that a lot and it\u2019s really hard and I don\u2019t want to like go back to square one of that. But then I saw her again and [inaudible \u2013 03:30]. I think that was more circumstantial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">[03:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: This was when you were on the bus with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: This was when I was at the bus stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it was at the movie theater.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: And then like last week I was at a coffee shop with a friend and right outside the window a car pulled up and she got out and started, you know, fussing with her stuff and got out and left. Or I don\u2019t know. But I was facing directly out in to the window and what sort of give that is I mostly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">was just like hmm, I don\u2019t really feel stressed about like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to feel stressed unless she walks in to this where I am, like the shop that I\u2019m in. But like seeing her doing whatever wasn\u2019t feeling stressful which was good because I just\u2026I guess seeing her [inaudible \u2013 04:45] just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">brought back so many negative like just really bad and made it like doing [inaudible \u2013 05:00] and just\u2026I don\u2019t think I don\u2019t to be\u2026like I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to do it. Like I do but I don\u2019t. If that makes sense. Because I didn\u2019t feel any like anything good about not being upset or scared of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B3\">her or having like longing for her and then the situation with the bus, I felt like I don\u2019t know. Like I rebooted almost. But that\u2019s what it felt like that; like on the moment, I just mostly just [inaudible \u2013 05:56], but once I got home and the next day, a few days I just got in the game. Oh God. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B4\">do I have to do this all over again?

And yeah, like there\u2019s that [inaudible \u2013 08:21] therapy is kind of [inaudible \u2013 08:23] hard. [Silence.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">I think what the other thing with that\u2026one of the things that I find helpful, sort of comforting, but something like that like when I\u2019m feeling [inaudible \u2013 10:13] is, I make myself do routines of like okay you have to get up by this time, you have to be out the door, you have to buy your coffee, your <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">thing. And like when you get home you have to do like these things. And I\u2019m doing that, but it\u2019s still like\u2026I guess it\u2019s not that it\u2019s not helpful because it is, but it\u2019s not being as, I guess, helpful as it usually feel like. I feel like I\u2019m still missing things and dropping things and not remembering. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">And like yesterday at work, I just had\u2026I was having one of those work days that was super disrupted which was like, I was so tired when I got in at 9:30. Someone came up, my coworkers, and was like, \u201cThere\u2019s nobody at the reference desk and someone needs help with microphone.\u201d I\u2019m just like, \u201cOkay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F3\">I guess I\u2019ll help them.\u201d And I asked them to like find a reference librarian from the office and have them come down because.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">[11:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">After they did that and then like I was up and down checking like something else for the [inaudible \u2013 12:03] so like I didn\u2019t like really sit at my desk for my 15 minutes [inaudible \u2013 12:10] \u2013ish, which I just felt like I couldn\u2019t carry a thought. If that makes sense. Like I thought I couldn\u2019t sit at <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">my desk long enough to sort of like I guess start like a thought and then finish it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">And then like I don\u2019t know. Like I just, I\u2019m so tired. And like I don\u2019t know; part of it, I\u2019m sleeping well. But also I just feel so like I feel really ambushed and overwhelmed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">[13:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: And\u2026I really don\u2019t like\u2026I think partially part of one of the things that was [inaudible \u2013 13:22] part of it was I was just like I can\u2019t go through this. Like I just felt like I don\u2019t like\u2026I kind of was coping with it, but I do\u2026I really feel like I was. It was kind of like I\u2019m making a series <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">of fly by night decisions that aren\u2019t exactly decisions; more like reactions. And like, I don\u2019t know; it\u2019s just so\u2026I\u2019m feeling so out of control and not able to like take care of me. And just like; yeah like, it\u2019s like does it get better? I was like could they like take care of me. I thought I was have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B2\">a hard time telling anyone else what was the problem and then also, which always stresses me out, like I ran out of the cat food. The one my cat likes. Cats like. And they both are meowing cats. So I was stressed about that. I\u2019m like I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re meowing, but I can\u2019t do anything about this right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">I don\u2019t know; just like all of that together just\u2026I guess it does like; it does make me feel crazy in a way, like\u2026like sometimes I\u2019m flatling and feel like, well, you know, maybe it\u2019s comic like a [inaudible \u2013 15:54] you\u2019re experiencing for longer time side effects. Or whatever. But I don\u2019t know. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">feel so frustrated in the end that like reading fiction and watching like TV or movies, which I do a lot, I don\u2019t know; I really don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t watch anything that like is difficult, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559738\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">[16:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">My roommate\u2019s obsessed with Breaking Bad, which I don\u2019t watch.

Which I actually feel bad about because through [inaudible \u2013 17:24] feeling bad. Like she feels bad that I am the\u2026I\u2019m exiling myself to my bedroom <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">and I feel bad that she feels bad about that. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Like [inaudible \u2013 17:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. And she look and says I\u2019m being ridiculous about not wanting to watch it. Or not\u2026if I\u2019m watching TV she\u2019s able to concentrate on anything at all, and I can\u2019t. I [inaudible \u2013 17:59] on the TV. It almost always distracts me, except for sports because there\u2019s no like [inaudible \u2013 18:08]. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">But I\u2019m also super stressed and I don\u2019t know [inaudible \u2013 18:21] who wants to help me with work stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I also find me super stressful and I don\u2019t know; like part of me is like yes. I do want to; like if you really can\u2019t get any [inaudible \u2013 19:01] also. That probably is like and what would they do? Like what would happen next? And also like and then really occupy here, like, maintaining my own <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">mental health. So if I were to choose, I would choose working and keeping me sane rather than dealing with sexual discrimination and [inaudible \u2013 19:26]. And sitting in that group office, I think you almost fall on everyone. It\u2019s really like\u2026I feel I can\u2019t relax and concentrate, relax or concentrate <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">or I don\u2019t know. Like it\u2019s different than being in like a cute farm and behind like there\u2019s a penis or whatever. Because like people are just students. They\u2019re just kind of like wandering in and out all the time. And I can\u2019t say no. Like because we\u2019re an open service area. We\u2019re supposed to help anybody <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D3\">that comes up.

Like [inaudible \u2013 22:08] and I guess you say what do you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200612\">want me to do about that? I have to work here too. And [inaudible \u2013 22:22] A; I don\u2019t care and B; I think it\u2019s a crappy set up.

[Silence.] I guess as a feeling sometimes, I\u2026some of this happened yesterday, [inaudible \u2013 26:38] to that. It feels [inaudible \u2013 26:45] like I\u2019m kind of jumping in to the sort of feelings or associations to what you\u2019re talking about kind of like both feet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">[26:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">Like yesterday; I about had, you know, something that you know was disturbing or that you weren\u2019t really upset about having had gone last week or was really shaken up by it. But I guess I had the impression that you know, well it\u2019s already going to be helpful to like [inaudible \u2013 27:23] mother and to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">[inaudible \u2013 27:25] your family. Maybe you probably already did, but to kind of be talking about that. Can also be pretty overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: I mean it feels like something you sort of lose control over a bit. Like I\u2019ve got to see what I\u2019m going to say about it. Yeah, which is what I want, but then sometimes also I\u2019m like I would just like, I don\u2019t know [inaudible \u2013 28:01].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">But it\u2019s like sometimes I feel like, okay, I thought I was dealing with this thing and then it\u2019s like, oh; but actually it\u2019s like this thing. You know, which is good to\u2026I\u2019m kind of like, I do want to know that; I just maybe don\u2019t want to know that right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Or you don\u2019t know what to\u2026I guess sometimes I don\u2019t know what to do with it. It\u2019s that like, okay, so I think about all these things but I\u2019m too tired to\u2026it\u2019s too much to think about it. Like to continue processing after.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: You are your own like this. And then it becomes this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Or does it seem to be this? I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: And that adds to the [inaudible \u2013 29:21].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think also a [inaudible \u2013 29:25].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: Just the sort of control with what you\u2019re actually dealing with or a [inaudible \u2013 29:36] really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">Another thing I want to say is, look, I know that at one level this is clearly what you expect and in some cases what you [inaudible \u2013 29:43] what you want or sort of what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: So I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m unaware of that. I\u2019m talking more; I\u2019m referring more to like what can feel much better in the moment or what can make it difficult. That kind of thing. If that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it does. And that sort of like; I mean [inaudible \u2013 30:19] conflicts or whatever in the moment is freaking really hard. Like\u2026I do anything talking about my mom is super hard in the moment because; part because like I, well, I know what it is. Like it\u2019s called; it\u2019s like, my brother\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">[inaudible \u2013 30:51] psychiatrist saying like the reason you\u2019re bipolar is because you\u2019re mixed race. And then sort of a few of like\u2026that was the thing that both my brother and I have heard. Like [inaudible \u2013 31:10] is well, you know, like I know [inaudible \u2013 31:14] failed marriages, but what about the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B2\">children? We get so mixed up and confused. Like we\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559738\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: That would be you and him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">[31:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, so it\u2019s like\u2026I mean we both say that to like me or him or my parents, which we both have. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s incredibly [inaudible \u2013 31:39]. It\u2019s incredibly weird. And so like my first reaction is generally like \u201cFuck you, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Like actually, I\u2019m also [inaudible \u2013 31:51]. What are you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">talking about? And so then it becomes difficult to be like, well, actually, mistakes are made but not because my parents are different races, but for other reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">And so sometimes it feels really hard to kind of like be like, nope, we\u2019re not, we\u2019re like this is not actually a discussion about whether or not my parents made a mistake in having children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: But like I guess like it\u2019s hard to\u2026that\u2019s my knee jerk reaction is to sort of defend the concept of having mixed race kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: And that like I have emotional problems not because of like racial [inaudible \u2013 33:06]. And that\u2019s also one of those things where I feel like people\u2026like people like to use the existence of interracial families and mixed raced people as like a metaphor. I was like, look; racism isn\u2019t over because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">of law or like I am the embodiment of the end of racism and racial unity and\u2026that\u2019s a lot for a person. And I also don\u2019t mix [inaudible \u2013 34:10] combination. And so I don\u2019t know. I feel like I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations in which I thought because I felt like, oh we\u2019re talking about me, but we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB2\">not actually; we were talking about like [inaudible \u2013 34:41]. Like they\u2019re trashing a mixed race person. The symbolic [inaudible \u2013 34:49] person. And so it\u2019s like I have this like, you know, a set of like things that [inaudible \u2013 35:13] getting out of that can be hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">But I\u2019m unwittingly trampling all this stuff. [Silence.] Yeah, I mean\u2026even if that is true, I just don\u2019t; I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think about that a lot. Probably because [inaudible \u2013 36:07] met the incredibly high standard of not [inaudible \u2013 36:10]. So good job. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">Or like over being, because over being can be like, yeah okay. High standards. But I mean it\u2019s more than I\u2019m like used to getting [inaudible \u2013 36:44]. I think like it doesn\u2019t always register.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. I would imagine that if it registered as such before now you would have said so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">[37:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah, coming from them, you have said things that I disagreed with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I did? Yeah, absolutely. This isn\u2019t coming across to me as something that you said if like knowing, had trouble saying so much as something that was unclear was kind of in the way that it was and making you feel bad in the way that it would.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. The other thing is that I\u2019ve been thinking is I\u2026when we talked at one point about doing like, I was surprised as to how strong of a reaction I had. The idea of not being able to see you. Like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559738\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah it was two; one was lie down and two; lying down and not being able to see you sort of come by and I just like\u2026which\u2026it\u2019s not the money\u2026has been an issue for me before and like I\u2019ve had male gynecologists and was like don\u2019t care, you know. Like the gender of like whoever is treating me <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD1\">doesn\u2019t\u2026has never been an issue for me. And suddenly I\u2019ll say, oh, this actually feels like a huge thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">[38:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">I got a [inaudible \u2013 38:40] massage recently and a friend of mine was like, oh, my male partner does massage and he might [inaudible \u2013 38:46] for barter. And I thought I\u2019m not sure if I can let a guy massage me right now. Like I have in the past, like a lot. Not a lot but like it\u2019s not been something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">that I\u2019ve cared about and I just had this like very strong sort of like nope; like nope, nope, nope, nope. And then had this week why is this; why is this so troubling to me right now? Like I guess [inaudible \u2013 39:38]. And it\u2019s still kind of percolating or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">Things, I guess, like your [inaudible \u2013 40:18] is like the environment in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s the fear of not being able to tell that it might happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: And then not being able to do anything about it. But if after the first fear, it is not being able to see [inaudible \u2013 41:00]. And that\u2026it\u2019s not something that\u2019s been like\u2026I don\u2019t; I don\u2019t like living like you\u2019re hanging, but I mean that\u2019s like [inaudible \u2013 41:28]. But just to me it\u2019s sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">like but I know who this person is and yet I still feel scared about it. And it feels like intensity like\u2026I guess I feel like I\u2019m like; I\u2019m even [inaudible \u2013 41:57] an irrational fear of like that\u2019s not actually going to happen. You are not going to leap out like an action move. But like it\u2019s just like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB2\">irrational crazy feeling like in my head. [inaudible \u2013 42:12] feel like I guess it\u2019s really like not getting a warning; not being able to read somebody else\u2019s body language or see that there is something. I guess not\u2026like not getting a warning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">[42:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: [inaudible \u2013 42:46] and all of a sudden just being [inaudible \u2013 42:49] with a monster. [Silence.] I think it\u2019s kind of\u2026it\u2019s a [inaudible \u2013 43:45] a lot of how I feel [inaudible \u2013 43:54]. I just be sort of what happened here? And I also sort of realized this but I was thinking recently how in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">doing like public speaking or [inaudible \u2013 44:23] meeting. I spend a lot of time looking at people\u2019s body language and like trying to\u2026I guess trying to read where; like reading is going, where people are going. Like I can get really caught up in like am I sitting pissed off? Am I sitting whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.
