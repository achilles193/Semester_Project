I\u2019ve been working on the same paper for the last couple of months. It\u2019s sort of been my big paper that I want to talk about in job interviews. So I\u2019ve been trying to finish it before I send out applications. But I both need <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">to send out applications because I need to have a job and also because there is sort of like I\u2019m anxious about where we will be. I can understand that. Uncertainty, I don\u2019t really like. I feel like I\u2019ve been putting her in a position of uncertainty for a while and I understand the concerns there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">So I finished that paper Sunday, which is a good thing. But this sort of anxiety attached to \u201cWill I ever finish this?\u201d Just get it done already. I\u2019m also in to like in to the job portion of I feel like I have to find the right job, you know, on one level, so that my wife doesn\u2019t kill herself. And on <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">another level, that I am happy somewhere for the next several years. On another level, so that I pick the right one so that I have the career that I want even though I don\u2019t exactly know what career I really want. It matters what I do next.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">And then in to the actual process of sending applications. I think I mentioned that in chemistry, almost all the post doc, positions, want to just send applications to people. So you noted that I like to construct rules to govern my environment or something. That particular feature is a strength in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">some areas when there is an actual posting for a job. I can write an application that indicates why I would be a good match for that position. When there is no posting, I know that the person who is reading it will still have a set of criteria. Well I have no access to what these criteria really are, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">so I have to sense that I have to say the right thing; I have to explain like how I would be a good fit for this position that may or may not exist based on criteria that I have no access to. So I find that nerve wrecking. [Pause].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">There\u2019s a sense in which all of it is okay. It\u2019s hard to deal with it and it makes me less efficient, the work that I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m like I just need to get through it and it will be done. It\u2019s okay. Did you finish the paper? I can get things done. I will get the application done. Probably today or tomorrow <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">I\u2019ll be sending them out. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">Sitting here looking for a good segue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">Another thing that I\u2019ve been anxious about is sort of where we left things last week. That\u2019s been less pressing in the last several days because I\u2019ve been much more anxious about these other things; certain things have been on my mind also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">So that\u2019s your series of questions\u2026not really related to each other. I don\u2019t want to come back to the last two in a moment, but start with the one at which you balked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I balked at one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: From over here you balked at it. I\u2019m sensitive to particular things. So, I asked if this was your first pregnancy and you sort of\u2026that was the moment at which you disengaged from directly asking questions and started, I felt like, harvesting more defensively. You were more reluctant to answer <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">some questions. That is one that I believe that you were more reluctant to answer. I could be wrong in that belief. Recognize that is the premise under which I\u2019m operating here.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562598\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">We talked a lot after I asked that about why am I so curious about your pregnancy. And so I\u2019ve continued to think about that question. I think there are several things going on. Like I said, a big snarl of things here. So just try to keep talking and see what we\u2019ll get.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">So I think the two things that I don\u2019t remember talking extensively about are one; I really want to have a family. So in a sense, you have this thing that I very much want and don\u2019t really see how I am going to have because I just really don\u2019t just [pause]\u2026I really get used to want to have children <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">with Tanya. In addition to wanting to have children, I\u2019m not sure that I want to have children with Tanya. I don\u2019t know if she can handle it. I don\u2019t\u2026you know. [Pause.] So, there\u2019s that. I feel like there may be a sense in which I am trying to appropriate your pregnancy, which sounds horrible. I\u2019m sorry <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">if that is potentially a thing that I\u2019ve been doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: When you say appropriate, how do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Like take a piece of it or something for myself, which is why it sounds horrible to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">I think another piece that\u2019s going on, most of the women in my life, one way or another are or have been pregnant. That\u2019s just sort of like both of my sisters are pregnant, have been pregnant; one of them is pregnant right now. Went in to labor briefly over the weekend; isn\u2019t in labor anymore. So have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">another niece in a week or so probably, which is wonderful. I\u2019m excited about it. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">So I just have a clear sense that it\u2019s not an easy thing. But it hasn\u2019t seemed to affect you at all in terms of like in your work life, which is great, I think. I can only assume. Speaks to your ability to like keep yourself separate and safe. But there\u2019s this sense that I have, I think, that like this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">must be challenging for you because it\u2019s been challenging for everyone else I\u2019ve known. So I feel like I\u2019m trying to say that it\u2019s okay for it to\u2026I don\u2019t need\u2026 [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">Like you\u2019re going to go away on maternity leave. Like there\u2019s reason they have maternity leave because like, you know, it\u2019s an important fit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: How is that related to being challenging or is it separate?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: No, no, I mean that\u2019s, in my mind, we have maternity leave because one needs maternity leave after childbirth in order to recover, relate to the child, take care of the child\u2019s needs, all of that. So we have some societal accommodation there. So sort of like it\u2019s not a secret that it\u2019s hard, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">I guess, is the other\u2026is how it was related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I see. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I think there\u2019s also the sense that like one of the things I\u2019d like to do in my other relationships is like be aware of the things that people are struggling with and sort of offer to talk with them about them; sort of tell them that I understand this is going on. So I think that I\u2019m trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">to do that and realize that our relationship is very different from my other ones, but I think that I\u2019m doing that anyway. So I think that\u2019s part of it. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">I think those are all like important things and I am glad to have said them and thought about them. I think they are important. But none of them; none of those or any of the other things, many things that I\u2019ve said on this topic actually get to like how did it come to be the case that I asked that question? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">[Pause.] It\u2019s all related because I do have all of those things. But the actual how it came to be is [pause]\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562598\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">Some time ago I asked you whether this would be your first child and you said it would be your first biological child. So a couple of weeks ago, then, I sort of\u2026and I phrased that question very carefully to avoid asking the question that I then later asked to like\u2026I did that because. Anyway. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">So a couple of weeks ago I sort of talked as if this were your first pregnancy, and so in harvesting you, you inquired as to why I would think that was the case. You were curious about that. And I sort of responded very quickly that that\u2019s what you had told me. And even shortly after that, but on reflecting <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">later, that\u2019s really not what you had told me. What you told me is that this would be your first child because that\u2019s what I had asked deliberately went into that question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">And so I then felt like perhaps I had dismissed very real and very trying struggles of yours and really don\u2019t want to have done that. And so I asked the question believing that it was likely that becoming pregnant has been a challenge and has been a hard, like a traumatic thing in other times for you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">Because I wanted to, I guess, apologize for dismissing that. So, that\u2019s the how it came to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: And was the hope that had I had a miscarriage or had an abortion or something like this \u2013 I guess those were the two conditions under which I would be pregnant and not have a child right, I guess those were the only two \u2013 that I would say more about that or just that it would be acknowledged <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">or what would happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a good question. [Pause.] Yeah, so when asking questions and thinking about it, I had a desire to tell you that I feel sorry for dismissing that experience and also to tell you that I was sorry for your loss if that were the case. [Pause.] That\u2019s about as far as it went. Like I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">[pause]\u2026it\u2019s sort of like I\u2026sort of like if I accidentally step on your foot when I was walking in here, I might say, \u201cDid that hurt?\u201d and then I would apologize for stepping on your foot. Normally I would probably just apologize because I\u2019m sure it would hurt, but like if I weren\u2019t sure I might ask <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">first. That\u2019s like a crappy metaphor for what I think was going on. I actually want to know, but that\u2019s like\u2026I also recognize that that\u2019s a level of knowledge about you that I have no reason to expect you would want me to have and I\u2019m actually really okay with that. But it\u2019s this idea that like I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B3\">unintentionally stepped on you that led me to ask the actual question. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">Part of my anxiety comes from the sense that my, in asking that question, and in feeling like you sort of pulled back at that moment as if that were like both a shocking question and perhaps too much; as if I had like in trying to fix something that I felt like I had done badly or yeah; that\u2019s close <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">enough. I had done another thing, I had asked too much or something. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">So I\u2019m going to move on to the other questions now. I asked you, I think, at the end of the last session that had you ever been suicidal and whether you would lie to me. You were struck by the pairing of those questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562598\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: Rightfully so. Particularly with [inaudible \u2013 20:53]. Some of that was the time constraints and some of that was like having the sense that I\u2019ve asked this question that you don\u2019t want to answer; trying to give you enough other questions that you couldn\u2019t possibly answer all of the questions <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">so we can both pretend that you\u2019re not avoiding any particular one. My instinct is to keep throwing other questions at you. I have many more, so it\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">Those two I asked in particular because I had been thinking, I think the day before, I asked them; like so I\u2019m anxious about asking those questions for, you know, reasons about me. Not about like asking too much if you\u2026those questions, I sort of was wondering are there any questions to which the answer <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">might fundamentally change my view of who you are or my view, my experience or my understanding of you? And so those were the two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">Have you ever been suicidal? Obviously my wife has been for a while and that has changed, radically, my view of her. I find myself unable, although that\u2019s not strictly correct, to trust her. Unwillingly, certainly hard. And so it\u2019s a sense in which the answer to that question has the possibility to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">shake me in some deep way. Either you, if you say yes; if you say yes, then either my relationship with you will change in some way internally or I will feel a certain way. Or I won\u2019t. And if I don\u2019t, then that means something about my response to Tanya. It seemed like an important question to at least <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B2\">talk about this part of what we\u2019re doing seemed important. I actually don\u2019t know how much it matters\u2026what the answer to the question is. And I think [inaudible \u2013 23:23] well it is vaguely related. It is, in a lot of ways, related to my friend Franco, if something is too uncomfortable for him, he will <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B3\">just lie to my face. I\u2019m kind of okay with it, and I\u2019m kind of really not okay with it. I don\u2019t have, I guess, my feelings on that sorted out. So I think that\u2019s sort of how that question came about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">I do have like actually specific concerns on that question, so I haven\u2019t told you what would happen if you said yes. Would you, if you had a theory about what would happen to me. Give me the answer you thought I needed rather than the true answer. That\u2019s part of the question, would you lie to me. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">I guess it has two parts to it. You wanted to harvest more; harvest [inaudible \u2013 24:18].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re doing just fine on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: Oh, but I\u2019m done. Those are all the things that I traced out to present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Clearly you thought about it. I will say with the question about whether I was\u2026I did sort of pause after you asked the question had I been pregnant before. And it wasn\u2019t\u2026it made me think that I didn\u2019t really like that question. And my not liking\u2026but the reason that I began to be more focused <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">on you is that my liking or not liking a question should not be the reason that I respond to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">So it wasn\u2019t that I was\u2026I mean maybe it seemed like I was becoming defensive. I didn\u2019t feel like, you know, defensive per se. I felt like I think I\u2019m losing the point here. It came to a question where I didn\u2019t like the question to make me think maybe I need to be rethinking, just answering your questions <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">because I think I\u2019m losing something in that. So that\u2019s why I shifted. Not necessarily that I was trying to avoid answering it per se.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562598\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: Are you willing to say anything more about what you mean by you didn\u2019t like the question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Just, I mean I\u2026it doesn\u2019t really bring up anything negative. But I didn\u2019t like it; it wasn\u2019t like, of the questions you asked, not a question I wanted to answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s what I mean by it. Not like I didn\u2019t approve of it, but it was yeah; it was something that I was less, sort of just okay, let\u2019s just answer that too. And then when I thought about that, I thought well my liking doing something doesn\u2019t mean that this is necessarily the most productive, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">or you know, something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">Liking is a little too strong, but kind of something around that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: Okay. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: Oh, where did you go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m actually just trying to wrap my head around what you said, like just internalize it. It seems to be slow or something in this specific context. If I\u2019m understanding correctly, your internal response to the question made you question the approach that you had been taking, so you changed the approach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Alright. [Pause.] I actually had nothing else\u2026other than I have read one of those books and liked it. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: Which one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Curious Incident \u2013 The Dog in the Night-time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a good one. That\u2019s a good book. Very quirky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: I mean there are so much that you\u2019ve said today that, you know, I would take up with you and sort of\u2026well, at least a couple of things are coming to my mind. The one thought I had is when you were describing just a lot of these things. Not all of your questions, but a lot of your questions <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">were about me; making sure I was okay and\/or like concerns about the challenges or the difficulties; that they have driven like a negative valance. You know like knowing a lot of other pregnant women and how difficult it is and like kind of along that vein. And I was sort of struck by that. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: I think I had the sense that one of the ways that people get through life is by sharing their joys and their sorrows with the people and normally, I can\u2026I have like the capacity to carry a lot of things so I can sort of carry other people\u2019s sorrows. It helps. And I like it too. I like to help <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B1\">people. I think that\u2019s sort of\u2026I think that\u2019s all I have are just thoughts. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">I think part of it is that most people, not necessarily me, but most people will sort of tell you or tell you, an arbitrary person, the things that I wish they\u2019re excited but won\u2019t necessarily say the things they\u2019re excited about that have been hard. That\u2019s where I think this sort of idea that being <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">aware of someone else\u2019s troubles is an important thing because may or may not like come out with it, but they almost certainly want to talk about it at least a little bit. Having to acknowledge that this is hard or exists. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">There are probably a lot of other ways to tackle this metaphor, but those are my first responses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: And do you feel that\u2019s somebody that I would want to do to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: No. I think not with me. I feel like it must be a thing that you want to do, but you know, you talk about taking care of yourself and having a good support network. Those imply that you do these things. Yeah. That was a sketchy response, but it covers the whole area.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562598\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">THERAPIST: Does it make you feel left out in some way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">CLIENT: [Pause]. Almost certainly. Like I don\u2019t have any real sense that you ought to, like, rely on me when I share these things. Phrasing that seems sort of absurd. [Pause.] But I felt like I talked many times about how strange it is for me to be in a relationship where like I share all of these intimate <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200991\">things and now myself like, you hear, perhaps; occasionally I mentioned in passing the good things in my life. But mostly I talk about the bad things here. So that\u2019s like one way our relationship is skewed. And then another is that like you just don\u2019t talk much about yours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">One of the struggles over the last several weeks is I feel like has been trying to, for me, trying to like take away the barriers to intimacy that I have made so that the ones that remain are natural in some sense of the ones that you aren\u2019t supposed to like the ones I\u2019ve made up for you to want or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">something. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">So I guess I also want to express some uncertainty at how I don\u2019t know; it\u2019s not for me to know [inaudible \u2013 35:38] like what you do and don\u2019t want to share. That\u2019s a part of exploring or growing or developing the relationship that we have, whatever exactly it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">THERAPIST: That I\u2019m not sure\u2026my other set of thoughts which I\u2019m sure are related somehow, is what you were saying earlier about thinking about in general, perhaps, my pregnancy, bringing even more to the forefront about wanting family or not wanting family, or not even knowing if it\u2019s possible with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">Tanya. And clearly that\u2019s\u2026thinking about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yes. [Pause.] I feel like I\u2019ve sort of said more or less what I had to say on the subject. I so want to say, yeah, you are hearing me correctly. That is a thing that I\u2019m thinking about and it\u2019s hard. But I guess that\u2019s not a sufficient prompt to talk about it further. Is that an okay thing to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Well clearly you have a lot of fears and fantasies about what this means. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry; what is the antecedent?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: What, in terms of like\u2026I mean there\u2019s\u2026I sort of understand like. I have some awareness of why you\u2019d be thinking about this; about Tanya in particular. But it seems like there\u2019s a lot more to it than just what you said in terms of how you think about having a family or not having a family. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A91\">So she\u2019s working as a nanny for three small children right now, so like it\u2019s the sense in which I know that she could do some of the tasks of it. I guess several particular anxieties that I have. I think I\u2019ll just list them or try to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">So the\u2026I really hate the word \u201chormonal,\u201d but emotional and hormonal changes that occurred during and after pregnancy can be very intense. And particularly for someone like Tanya who\u2019s already very, in some sense, unstable. Like right now she\u2019s relatively stable. She goes in to zones of instability <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">where small impulses like had disproportionate responses from her. I\u2019m anxious about that time period. Both pregnancy and post-partum. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">One of the reasons that she\u2019s able to\u2026she works as a nanny three days a week, ten hours a day, which is really intense. It\u2019s pretty tiring for her, but being a parent is 164 hours a week. You don\u2019t take time off. That\u2019s not to say that one can\u2019t construct one\u2019s life so that the children go to daycare <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">or have a nanny. The parents don\u2019t share the labor, but it\u2019s always there. You don\u2019t walk away from it. Like she could always just quit her job right now. It\u2019s not okay to quit children. It\u2019s just not okay. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562598\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">That\u2019s exactly what her mother did to her. So there are some real similarities between her and her mother. Some of those are presumed genetic and some of those are presumably, I believe like, angry person raises children and turns them in to angry people and they raise children and turn them in to like\u2026the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B11\">damage seems to propagate regardless of the genetics of the situation also. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">There are like two sets of fears there. One is that she will behave in a way that her mother did. And one is that she will inflict the damages that were inflicted on her on our children because there\u2019s a real sense of\u2026she feels like she\u2019s inflicted them on me. So I think that\u2019s a list of my major concerns. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">[00:00:41:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I can certainly see as much as you\u2019re happy for me that this has\u2026this is tough. This can be tough for me being pregnant to the extent that it, you know, brings up this issue more even though it sounds like it\u2019s on your mind anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">CLIENT: You know I actually think that you being pregnant is a good thing. I\u2019m very happy for you and hopeful that things will be good for you and [inaudible \u2013 42:34]. It sounds like it\u2019s given us an opportunity to talk about these things. So thank you for that particular way of phrasing it. But I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B91\">think so. I actually\u2026thank you for indulging me talking about these things while you\u2019re pregnant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Indulging sounds so trivial, for a lack of a better term. I\u2019m not doing it to indulge you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">CLIENT: You know that always brings me out this question of why are you here? Why do we do this? Like what\u2026? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s certainly a non-trivial question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">CLIENT: [Laughs.] Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">[00:00:43:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">You know one of the other things that, [inaudible \u2013 43:58] in all of this is I feel like I\u2019m trying to work out these issues that I have with [inaudible \u2013 44:02]. I\u2019m working them out at you or something. I feel like that could be challenging or something to you. So particularly in you shifting how <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C51\">you were responding to it. I felt more anxious about it. But you having said what you said, I sort of\u2026I guess I understand better that there was no particular\u2026talking about my fears of being off-putting. So\u2026and I\u2019m also sensitive to changes in the world around me of any kind, particularly other people. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C52\">Who knows why? I just know\u2026so. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">That\u2019s something that plays in to my mind. Phrasing internships there. [Pause.] I feel like I\u2019m asking a lot, but you need not be willing to give, and I really appreciate that you\u2026 [Pause] see me at all, but also are making extra time for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">[00:00:45:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">Here, even though I am who I am I guess, or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re anxious about what you\u2019re asking or from me on a lot of different levels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.
