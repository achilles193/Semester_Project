(Laughs) I don't really want to talk about it but I suppose I should.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">(Pause): [00:00:49 00:00:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Maybe we I could talk about from where we left off last time. (Laughs) That might be a good option. I don't know if you had any comments or questions after what I shared last time because it was I haven't quite if it sounds weird or that stuff about my parents or like the first few years <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">in the U.S. I don't know if you wanted me to talk more about that or if you have any insight. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">(Pause): [00:01:35 00:02:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Well I think you're talking about all this was very important but you started by saying you have something you should be talking about today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: (Laughs) I mean I'm sure it's all connected in some way because it's my experiences and some things might be linked but this weekend I found out that Victor (sp?) is seeing someone (laughs) so that had a weird kind of effect on me so I was trying to deal with that. So I've been kind of numbed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">by this. But I don't want to talk about it because I feel like the only way to get over someone is just absolutely nothing about them at all. It's possible to move away or like immerse yourself in work and make as many new friends as possible and just completely avoid everything that reminds you of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">them. Unfortunately, I'm not able to do that because I have to drive down that same street to visit my mom and like I'm with Chris who kind of reminds me of him because they're friends or were friends. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">(Pause): [00:03:40 00:03:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: So, I'm feeling that that could be an option (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: No, that's okay. I walked really fast here, to get here and it makes me warm. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Oh, I hadn't thought. I could put on the air conditioning. Hold on one second.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: That's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: It's been so hot in here I'm actually uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">(Pause): [00:04:19 00:04:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I want to do that, like not at all think about him but in my head I've allowed myself to think about him and this has been going on for several months, I know six months and I really want me back. (Laughs) I want that portion of me that has been obsessing for him to come back to me. Plus, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">it's been very like that resolution I cannot (unclear) good guy or not, did he take advantage of me like everyone I know tells me he did? Why do I even need a resolution to move on, you know? Why do I need a closure or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">(Pause): [00:05:41 00:05:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: So yesterday I was talking to my old roommate and she also kind of broke up with this guy and she's like, you know what? He was just like chocolate for me, you know? It's like not seeing him is like giving up chocolate. And I didn't understand what she meant but I was like I thought what she <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">meant was chocolate is very important to her but I think what she was saying was that it's not like air, you know, that you would die without him, but I have that that's what I felt Victor (sp?) was for me, like air absolutely vital. That was the case in March, April, May, June, July and it sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B2\">of tapered off. But I really invested a lot in that kind of space that I shared with him. I wanted him to be that important to me. I felt like I was cheating on him if I even shared something beautiful with someone else. And this whole time I felt like I was cheating on him because I was seeing Chris <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B3\">and stuff. But once I shared that with him and he just laughed at me and said, 'oh my gosh, you're so monogamous.' (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559412\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">So I really I mean I guess he also was kind of blessed that I placed a lot of importance to what he brought, not just emotional support, but you know, his way of (unclear), referring to that, that Chris's way of life as dedication to work and to deriving a sense of self from that versus Victor (sp?)'s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">way of life in deriving your sense of self from just being alive or something on that sounding very nice and (laughs) like his expense and something like that, etc., etc. I feel like if I could just take the lessons that he's taught me and just have them as not his, not associating them with him and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">then just learn from them if I want to. Just completely cut him off and like and you know, just agree with Chris and everyone else that he's a bad guy and just move away, move on. It's really painful to keep wondering, keep thinking hopefully. At first I was very happy being hopeful. I was like in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D3\">this daze, on this cloud. But now it's making me feel very stupid. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Can you qualify \"monogamous\" with an effort? It's sort of like saying, \"she's so pregnant versus 'she's kind of pregnant.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Either you're pregnant or you're not. You're either monogamous or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I guess so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: \"You're so monogamous.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: That I could even feel like I'm cheating on him if I make out with a girl. (Laughs) You know? (Laughs) But I don't want to. Whatever, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">That's his treating of me and his treatment of me has been very, very negative and that's made me very insecure if it was even possible for me to be any more insecure about myself. (Laughs) That's not helping any, I'm sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">(Pause): [00:09:51 [00:10:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: It seems like you feel Chris is an unbiased party.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Well, well by saying, 'Chris's saying I should get on,' you know, get over him. Of course, he's going to feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. And he keeps saying, 'don't think of if you cannot think objectively about he did to you, think about what he did to me. I was his friend and he just did not even you know.' And that's true. I mean I actually cannot think about Chris.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: That's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Because when I told him, 'when I think about you, I think if I say, look what Victor (sp?) has done?' When I do that my conscience says, 'no, look what you have done.' No, that's worse. You Chris way more than Victor (sp?) loved Chris, you know? (Laughs) So and so Chris is like, 'no, I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">so bad, like I am really bad.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It's hard for you to think of Chris as a human.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Well, like he just, the way you feel about him makes him seem like this parental person and also this kind of, like he has needs. Not that I feel that you're being \"insensitive.\" Like in a pejorative sense. But it's like it's hard for you to see that he has his own biases and viewpoints and needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559412\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I do see them and I am critical of Chris. But it's like how can you be critical like you said, a parental figure like it breaks your world to be critical of those who you look up to because, it would break my world if I poked too many holes. Like he's my base.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Break your world is quite a that's quite a statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Well, my world it feels like it's been in pieces for a long time and I'm conscious when I say that, I'm conscious that it's my thinking and I'm very afraid of that (unclear) of thinking because it can clearly debilitate me. But you have to build your world on something, right? Don't you? <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">Or no? (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">(Pause): [00:12:15 00:12:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I think that's true. It depends on what you're building your world on. It's complicated when you build your world on an ideal parental figure. I mean even the idea I have to think about this more, but even the conception of Victor (sp?) taking advantage of you sort of speaks to you as David <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">and him as Goliath, as opposed to two consenting adults.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: But that was my understanding for the longest time. That's how I explained it and didn't have any ill will towards him. But that's really making me look I feel like I'm just a little child again looking up to him with all this love in my eyes and it's just not going to be reciprocated, so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: But there's a difference between seeing him as treating you badly and him taking advantage of you. And taking advantage of you implies kind of a power difference. Him treating you badly still recognizes that he was unkind to you but it's a little bit different. Maybe I'm just parsing words. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">I don't know. But it feels different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: No, I mean that's true. Like if I say he took advantage of me then that definitely gives him more power and makes me sort of like this idiot who didn't really have any power during those months. And maybe Chris would like to think of him that way just so that he can I don't know. Deal with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">it. Put him in a box and forget about him and kind of forgive me and (laughs) have me back again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">(Pause): [00:14:16 00:14:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: But I just want a solution to this ache of feeling not I want to get over him so if thinking that he treated me badly and I should have some self-respect if that is going to do it, then I'd like to think that way. But I'm aware that Chris has his bias when he says, 'he took advantage of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">you.' (Laughs) It's quite convenient for him to think that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Right, because it takes away the fact that you made a choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: It sort of negates that you have desire and will and interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">(Pause): [00:15:23 00:15:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: But if I look at me that way I just feel like I'm that desiring subject and I'm not sure bad things happen to desiring women (laughs) and unfortunately, the conjecture is not far from reality. I don't want to be that desiring subject because I feel like I will desire Victor (sp?) again and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">shouldn't. I really shouldn't. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: What's the alternative to a desiring subject?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: A non-desiring one. Someone who has everything that she needs with that should find all those resources around her in her work and in other friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559412\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">(Pause): [00:16:26 00:16:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: This morning I woke up and I looked up because I didn't really know the meaning of this word.

(Laughs) Or, at least I was told that I was out of control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">(Pause): [00:17:06 [00:17:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: I want to be positive and I want to be productive and happy.

It was kind of really like a bachelor pad with just lots of books and bookcases and it wasn't cozy and stuff. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">So, I can to that had I was just feeling kind of numb from Victor (sp?)'s thing and my mom and Chris were moving furniture around, seeing things and I was kind of aware of this like voice in my head that was telling me almost feverishly like, 'you have to be here. You have to be present 100%. You have <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A72\">to be happy. You have to make all of this happen and you have to make it beautiful and you have to stop looking outside and like this is it. This is your shot. This is your second chance.' You know? Be engaged.

I guess sometimes it just comes naturally and some other times it's hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">(Pause): [00:21:24 00:22:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: I feel like there is this fear in me that something, and I just don't know what it is what I'm afraid of.

Like, it never will reach that low point like emotionally. But even if it did, why should I be so mortified if I I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">(Pause): [00:22:56 00:23:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: What would that look like for your life to turn out like your parents' life in the U.S.?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Do you mean what was my parents' life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: No. Like what I guess I got, I was sort of surprised by that association because I can't imagine what not what their life was like, but how you imagine your life could be like theirs in what way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: I don't know. I certainly have images of that time that were really (unclear) depressing. Just you know, horrible. The place messy and like messy as hell (laughs) and you know, my dad cheating. I don't even think it could be called \"cheating\" because my mom knew everything. (Laughs) And you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD1\">know, her just absolutely miserable and making a complete fool of herself and -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559412\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Fool of herself in terms of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: Well like he completely manipulated her. He said, 'I'm telling you everything I'm doing. I being honest with you.' And you know she did everything. She had she was the one with the job. She made all the she paid all the bills but still he managed her money and after all that he kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">really made her suffer, like psychologically, he would say all kinds of nasty things about her and to her face and she's a complete wreck now in the sense not a wreck, but like she has abysmally low self esteem and she can't make any decisions. Like if you ask her, 'what do you want?' She has absolutely <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C12\">no choice. No desire. She could have been so she was so powerful and strong and stuff. And then he took that away from her and kept kind of emotionally abusing her by taking her money and abusing her completely and classically stupid, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">And she has nothing. She had nothing. I feel I wish I could stop thinking about her sympathetically, but that's what I think, you know pathetic. I feel very, very sad about her. I wish I could feel differently, not be so mortified and afraid and just really just yeah, like debilitated by that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">She kept this from me for the longest time but she didn't tell me about his habits until like I was 19 or 20.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Did you suspect?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Where did you think he was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: We didn't so he would always keep, like in my childhood he was not around very much so he would keep going to different cities. It was kind of shocking when I was 20 and then just learned this woman who used to come by (laughs) who I got really attached to was, he was like he was having <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB1\">an affair with her and it was terrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: You liked her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.

I had friends and I had a boyfriend who taught me everything. He taught me how to drive and another parental figure. (Laughs) But I mean in the end, even that kind of turned very ugly because we were friends from church <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD1\">and that betrayal (unclear). I don't know if I got over that. I had like tons of friends. I must have had like 50-60 friends in college and that church.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: And they all just shunned you because of your parents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah. And you know that thing where we ended last time, that thing that my dad did where he kind of used them for his own ?

But then when that was gone, I felt like we just had to make our own little U.S. Like we were still living here and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F31\">were citizens and it was just a different engagement with the U.S. Like I felt more free. I felt like we don't have to be completely Americanized. We didn't need to be religious, like we could be humans again or something. (Laughs) I don't know if that's the case. But you know, like we could have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F32\">other Nepalese friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: The church you got involved in.

You immediately think, 'oh my gosh,' and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB1\">they tell you to think of all those people you know who are unsaved and immediately my mind went to my mom and the person I love the most so you know, I know once I knew about (unclear) I had to save her literally and spiritually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: And she was ripe to come on board?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean she was reluctant at first but then she said, 'I saw all the changes in you and I was interested.' And she was going through much more of hell than my dad, so. She's always had this spiritual bent I guess even in Nepal when he was doing all that.

I wonder if the name of that glass wall is self-loathing, you know? If that's the thing that keeps me from being there 100%, being free and being myself and, yeah, like inviting criticism as well as nice things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">THERAPIST: So being trapped but also being kept safe by the glass wall like both functions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Kind of dismissive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean sometimes it's good to be dismissive, to take yourself lightly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">THERAPIST: I don't actually see those as the same things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">CLIENT: (Laughs).
