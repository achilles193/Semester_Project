(pause at 00:04:44 until 00:04:52) I talked to my mom on Thursday. (sighs) Thanksgivings are not good holidays for her. I mean holidays are not good days for her.

It was fine but she started using \"we\" to refer to symptoms that she thinks that both of us have. Again. And I'm sure that that is correct with her and to some extent is correct with me when she talks about it. \"We just give too much. We're just givers. We <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">give all. Everything.\" You know first of all like yes that's a symptom but most of the people who say like when you say, \"I just give too much.\" It's really it's really something you feel pretty good about and aren't ready to let go if that's the way you phrase it. I'm not really sure that I've <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200352\">been giving very much. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: I mean like I recognize that impulse and I think it was pretty dominant in me for a long time.

Otherwise maybe we're (inaudible at 00:06:40). Maybe we're not. But I would like her to be able to distinguish between us. (pause at 00:06:47 until 00:06:54) She thinks (inaudible) break up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Oh it was really awkward because James was in the room because it is a studio apartment. (laughs) And she started kind of tiptoeing not very gently around it. And I mean it was very sweet in that she ended with wanting to make it very clear that I was her daughter. So that if James and I broke <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">up she was going to pick me. And that's nice but she started off by saying, \"You're never going -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: You okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah I just scratched my neck.

Like no, no. \" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: No. It was just weird. (pause at 00:08:06 until 00:08:14) And now I feel like (pause at 00:08:14 until 00:08:21)-now I'm anxious about telling people that we fight a lot because I feel like people jump to we're going to get divorced. And like, \"No! That's not going to happen.\" I'm not really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">sure of very much but I'm really sure that James and I are going to be okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: I'm fairly certain it's going to take a ton of work but we can do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.

In some ways it was a really good conversation. She's one person who doesn't want to ignore the fact that I've been in the hospital and that that's basically all I can think of to talk about right now. She really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">wants to talk to me about that and (inaudible at 00:09:40) and stories about stuff like that. That's a really good thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">It was good for me to be able to talk to her. Actually I think I started talking (inaudible at 00:09:55) because her psychiatrist now is refusing to prescribe (inaudible at 00:10:04) which she had been taking primarily for sleep but also for anxiety. And it's this like this weird thing where she's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">talking around and around and around and she really doesn't think that she's addicted to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: And I'm kind listening to her and I'm like, \"Maybe you might want to think about this.\" She was contradicting herself when she talks about how often she takes it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: And has like hoarded the last few that she has for emergencies.

And I don't know that that's true or not but I read one article about it. Or think that was about switching from Xanax to Clonapan. (inaudible at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">00:11:52) upset about that. But I just people are just weird about drugs. Prescribers and patients alike are just weird about them. I don't know. I'm getting off the Xanax now. (inaudible at 00:12:13) taper and I'm really glad of that because the nurses some nurses give me the side eye because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200772\">take a stimulant for anti-depressant and I take -(inaudible at 00:12:26) help me sleep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Like that is weird to them. Or there is just like so much addiction around it. And you know (sighs). I guess the thing that is important to me is that there is nothing I can say to influence people's opinions as to whether or not I'm addicted to any particular medication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Because if I say, \"No I'm not.\" Then I'm in denial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Right.

(pause at 00:13:00 until 00:13:07) And then that of course makes me doubt myself. (inaudible at 00:13:11) you go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.

(inaudible at 00:13:50) (pause until 00:14:02) I don't know how to [think clearly] when I'm talking to her. I should've said, \"Please don't talk about your symptoms and my symptoms as we because they're not necessarily the same. We don't (inaudible at 00:14:21)\". I should've <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">said something. I've said something in the past. (inaudible at 00:14:27) And she's just kind of forgets or something. (inaudible at 00:14:33) I did say something to the effect of, \"I really don't think that James and I are going to break up.\" And you know she backpedaled really fast.  (pause until 00:14:56)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Um (pause at 00:14:56 until 00:15:04). Isn't it kind of impossible to (inaudible at 00:15:05) that way? Like either in that when she's saying something about you so often she's really saying something about herself, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah like eighty percent of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Not all of the time. But three out of five.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:15:27) Yeah. With the symptoms and with James it would seem that way to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: And mostly that's what she's got. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: And it's sort of a mixed bag. You can say something or push back on that like I guess you did on the stuff with James but not with stuff with the symptoms. And she sort of backpedals but then you kind of lose her I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: She sort of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: She gets really hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. It really hurts her feelings.

I don't know what mothers are supposed to be like or do. (pause at 00:23:42 until 00:23:52) Yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201051\">I think people use people talk about mothers symbolically. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">Kind of talk about unconditional love and (inaudible at 00:24:06) taking care of children or whatever. Even to talk about tension between mothers and children when the children are teenagers. And it's not just that like that all that whole discussion just leaves me cold it's that when I heard the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201071\">words \"unconditional love\" I just bristle because that doesn't -. It's like all the things that mothers are supposed to be or that parents are supposed to be it's not just that I don't like that I don't have them it's that I doubt that they exist. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">THERAPIST: I see.

Yeah. Or the phrases feel like empty rhetoric. You know like when people talk about freedom. (inaudible at 00:25:30) what does that mean? It doesn't mean anything.

(pause at 00:27:35 until 00:27:42) It's not that mom is lying it's that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201231\">she doesn't know that she's not telling the truth. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">CLIENT: She doesn't know that there is a me to know.
