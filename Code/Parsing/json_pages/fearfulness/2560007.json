Yeah, so... well, there are several... NSA thing keeps getting to me, which is ridiculous because they don't care who I am. [0:00:59] They're not looking at me, they don't care to look at me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: But yeah, what is it really about (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I don't know. (Pause) Yeah, so I have been to websites that, when I got there, I was like, oh, this is not necessarily safe. These are places which have forum titles like Jailbait. I mean, okay, I should not be on this site. This is a bad place to be. But still, I have been there. And that sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">of thing worries me. I'm like, are there any images burned onto my hard drive that I would go to jail for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Mmm. That they'd see and watch?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Right. And I don't think so, right? And it seems irrational that there would be there because I don't have child porn on my computer, right? But still... I don't know. I don't know why it's so terrifying to me. [0:01:56] Just like, it happened in my iMac to the Apple store. It had all those <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">photos of this one model who's 18 years old, pretty freshly 18 years old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Oh, I recall that. And you (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was like, what if someone thinks she's underage? What happens then? It's embarrassing. First, one of my greatest fears in the world is prison, just a terrifying idea to me, to the point where every time I think about it I can contemplate briefly suicide. I'm like, well, I'll just kill <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">myself. That can never happen to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah, but it's like going to hell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, worse in that it's a real place (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Worse. Well, I say that, too, because it's also I think linked a lot to... if I look at the wrong thing, that this has been deeply ingrained in you. [0:02:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: If I look at the wrong thing, I go to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Judgment place. Yeah, it's something horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Really, it's deep though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and so... and it terrifies me, because that was years ago that I was even... went there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: But it still terrifies me, because well, big data. How far back are they going to go? And again, are they even going to care? They're like, oh, look. Here are thousands and thousands of web accounts that briefly touched on pages that are unsafe. And considering that people spend a lot of time <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">on some of these sites, I mean, there are bigger issues than I am. There are people who are actually downloading stuff they shouldn't be downloading. And like, that's really what people have to worry about.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560007\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well, let me ask you this, what is it like when you see that's... when you go to a site like that? What... tell me just about if and what you find about the appeal to it, and then what happens after that you get hit with... when the fear comes in? [0:03:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: So I... those points actually when [you really didn't] (ph). You're like, I haven't found anything that's really interesting, and... because you go looking for a specific thing. It's like, I'm looking for this rare set of this 18 year old model, for instance. And you're looking pretty deep into <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">Google links, maybe three pages in, maybe in two, it's like, oh, here's this forum site that has these. And you go there, to that specific forum for that specific reason. But then you can see that there are tags for other things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: You're like, ah, okay, this is... I should not be here. I should not be here. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Because you'll be what, in a... what do they call it, a portal that could then take you to... there's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:04:47) there's the forum. It's like, here's where... here's the sort of things you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Here's the sort of pictures we have. And then, oh, and are jailbait. I'm like, fuck, dude.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Will you ever click on the jailbait? [0:04:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, years ago, it's like, what's in here? And you're like, oh, clearly, these are 14-year-old girls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: And you're like... and they're clothed, but still you're, okay, this is not... this is technically in that area of, no, this should not exist. And, [because of the name of it] (ph), there's an aspect of, oh, that's interesting. That's real dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: But then that's what terrifies me. Like, no, that's mania. Mania is what is risky. I don't want to be involved in risky things. But the mania can make you take risks. It can make you think that terrible ideas are good ideas. So that really scares me, that really scares me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: But there's a drive... there's also the drive, the excitement to it, the danger?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: There's a curiosity, I suppose. But (pause) in reality those things aren't sexual, you know what I mean? [0:05:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: They're not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Well, there was a point where I was like... years ago, it was like, oh, I can probably also be attracted to 16-year-old girls. [All right, that's a thing] (ph). But as I got older I'm like, no, because now they look like children. And even young college girls now, like, oh, wow, that's just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">very young (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Ah, uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: So (pause) yeah. So I don't have those things. I don't... I try not to go to any place that could potentially have that sort of material on the site any more. It just seems not worth any sort of potential risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: And I don't know that... does it sound at all like you're... I mean, that you're drawn to the sexual component of it? I mean, it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: No, I mean (pause), [I think] (ph) in the worst times it was like, I shouldn't be here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I see, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: It's like, oh, that's what's interesting, is like, how far can I look before I see something...?

I saw something I shouldn't have seen. I need to go away. And I've done recursive deletes of hard drives, (inaudible at 0:07:20) no record of that should even exist on those hard drives. But what's the rational thing, [every time] (ph) I tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">myself, is that nobody is looking for these things. What people are looking for is for creators of this stuff and people who are distributing it and collecting it, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Well, what I want to say about it is that it hearkens back to this... what you were talking about last week about the pot dealer, that, of course no one's going to go after a simple drug deal for a guy buying pot of all things, right? [0:07:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Right, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: But that doesn't matter. That fear is there. That danger is there. There's something that you find... I mean, I was thinking that it has both the danger element, which it sounds less so in the pot situation, but the (crosstalk)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Well, there used to be more of it. There used to be more of that fear back when pot was extremely illegal, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Right, right. And that you end up also feeling that, if you look in that area or you go to that area, there is going to be real... there's a potential for real trouble. Someone will find it and do something about it. There's that level of (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it's a scary world when you have a privatized business system that wants more people. And so it gives me that fear of, okay, there are people who are looking for more people... [0:08:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: And like, but where are they really looking? I'm like, they're really looking at poor people. They're really looking at poor people, people who are going to fall through the cracks. They're not looking for white, middle-aged, middle class dude whose computer was once briefly on the wrong site.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah. No, I think that's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Right? I'm being rational about it, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: You're absolutely being rational about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: There's no (crosstalk) nothing to worry about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: No, you don't... you have nothing to worry about. But, I mean... yeah. And what I'll say is that, it's the fear that I think is very important here, which is a fear that I think has been with you for a while (chuckling), this fear of... I think what we're... I think that real fear comes from <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">is, your exploration of things that was typical, whether it's sexual or just being curious about the world, I don't know, with your mother was seen as very threatening and very, you're going down some path that's going to take you to hell.

There's this feeling that it's loaded with danger and something they're going to punish you for. That... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Well, and it's terrifying, it's just terrifying. What's especially terrifying is the mania. It is... (Pause) Ever (ph) get into a place where I think it's a good idea to take one risky step...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Because I'm actually very risk-averse...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: Which make mania scary.

That's what I envision for the future. As information becomes more and more prevalent, as this sort of stuff that's happening now with the spying becomes the domain of every man, once we can all just do it, once the tools exist, someone creates <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">the tools, like, hey, don't worry. We can spy on everyone now. When that happens, when information is totally and completely open, your best bet is that those in power want you to go to work, make money, consume, retire, continue to consume throughout your entire life.

This is Brave New World. Just, everyone chill, which we're getting closer and closer to. People are more and more legalizing weed. They're like, it's cool. Go to work. Come home. Smoke your weed. Consume. Go to sleep. Wake up. Go to work. Go home. Smoke your weed. Consume. Do this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">throughout your entire life, [because that's good] (ph) for the economy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. [0:12:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: And that's what we really have to hope for, is that people are benign, is that the people who are in these agencies who are doing the spying are actually benign and actually have the country's best interests at heart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: That's what we have to hope for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: [That's a horribly dystopian] (ph)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's what you have to hope for, is that elected officials and those people in power are there because they believe in true American ideals. They're there because they are the most dedicated servants to the country, the most patriotic of patriots. That's what you have to hope, is that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C31\">those people are (crosstalk)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: They don't have, nefarious kind of... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: That those people have scruples. Those people are not going to leverage the potential access they have to do things they shouldn't do, to put their attention in places it does not belong, to go rooting for people. [0:13:59] IT seems like... (Pause) It seems like if you did enough digging on <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C71\">anyone you could find something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: And again I think the people who have the most incentive to keep this stuff tightly regulated are politicians, because if it is ever turned to them, what happens? Every politician to whom attention has been turned in this way has had something, every single time.

[0:15:57] And of course such things shouldn't be illegal at all. They should be regulated and taxed and certified and all those things. I mean, ridiculous. We have so many ridiculous laws.

(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: But, I mean, the world has to become a better place.

And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but you've got to trust in... yeah, the benign intentions if you can kind of sleep... put your head down on the pillow at night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:16:45] I mean, can we trust that, in this age of terrorism and the need for tools to find and kill terrorists, that we can somehow hold onto these ideals, these American ideals of freedom, of liberty, of government of specific rights that we've... that were created for us, that we all <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB1\">agreed on (inaudible at 0:17:17)? (Pause) Can that happen? Can we maintain that? We are the most powerful military in the world without question. It's... we can be more places in force more quickly, than any other military in the world. China's got a huge standing army, but... (Pause) What, they have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB2\">no distribution. They have no bases across the world. They'd have to actually go conquer those spaces, whereas we already conquered them. We're just hanging out. [0:17:57] We're like, oh, no, we're just here for your own protection. But if you step out of line we'll just start killing people, so don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB3\">step out of line. But what I do like is that other countries, like Europe... is we are training insurgents in other countries. It's like, are you rebelling? Apparently Europe is supporting a lot of Syrian rebels with training and non-lethal things, and, yes, go overturn the government. More power to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB4\">you. And I think there's a lot of value to that. I think there's a lot of value to us being in the Middle East. And people are like, oh, war. I'm like, eh, no. We actually need to fight this war.

[0:18:56] It's not going to be like, ah, okay, they pulled out of here. Let's... everything's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF1\">fine now.

You cannot do it. For as long as they remain a Mormon, this person should be a secondor third-class citizen to you in terms of their intellect. These are people who are frankly worthy of contempt. [0:19:56] Once they've been exposed <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F71\">to the truth and choose to deny it, that is contemptuous. That is bad for the species. That is less involved than the rest of us. That is contemptible, because Mormonism is... my friends are like, why do you pick on Mormons, and... all religions fit. That doesn't matter, I said. In every religion you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F72\">can argue that your stuff was divinely inspired. You can be like, no, no, no, God actually spoke to Abraham, and this is what he said to say. [With the Mormon faith] (ph) you can say, Joseph Smith is a liar, and we know he's a liar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: And we can prove that he's a liar in several different instances. And so clearly... [just look how church policy] (ph) changed in relation to history of the time. Now they're like, oh, this is evil. Oh, is that not popular? Oh, it's fine now. It's fine. I mean, it's just so obviously fake and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB1\">manufactured and run by humans for political, economic means.

It's not the people are evil. It's that they were sold something when they were a child...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: And so they believed it, and so they told their children to tell their children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: And again it's not like everyone's like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">THERAPIST: And only a good intellect would kind of snap out of it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Or you get somebody that kind of helps you get...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">CLIENT: And even... I remember the guy who was touted as the smartest Mormon in the world. And he was a smart guy. He'd been to college. He even had his Master's in something.

And he could explain the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F1\">Bible to you, and that... he could explain all the weird things that didn't make sense...

And I remember thinking like, ah, okay, this guy's supposed to be really smart. I had a class with him one time, young men's deacons (inaudible at 0:22:08).

He says, you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201131\">a basketball player...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: The what situation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">CLIENT: This following situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">CLIENT: So you're a basketball player in high school, a really good basketball player.

Should you take two years off and go on your mission, or should you skip your <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B1\">mission, take the scholarship, and go to college? And I said, scholarship. And he's like, no, no, no. Your mission. Why? Well, because if you don't do your mission now, you might not do it after college, and you want to have had your mission before college so you're better prepared to face the challenges, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B2\">the temptations of college.

[0:26:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">CLIENT: Who would make me gay and then want me to suffer. And it's like, good, good for you. Yes. This is your first warning. Any... in any system where it comes out that God is an asshole, it's probably an incorrect system, given that the basis... some of the most basic tenets of (inaudible at 0:26:26) <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F1\">teaches that God is love and that is what is professed and taught, then at any point in which your system indicates something different, that should really raise a flag for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">THERAPIST: That should (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">CLIENT: (Crosstalk) wait a minute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">CLIENT: Why...? Well, that's interesting. As Sam Harris says, it's like, we talk about these particular gods of Abraham. [0:26:54] And he's like, but then you look at tsunami in Japan. He's like, and all these parents, cradling the dead bodies of their children, praying to God that something will be <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201771\">done. He's like, and their prayers will not be answered. And he says, given all the horrible suffering in the world, all the people who pray to God for deliverance and then are not delivered, he says you have to either conclude that, if this God exists, he's either impotent or evil.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">CLIENT: Either he can do nothing, or chooses to do nothing. (Pause) So why do you believe in him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Mmm. And why do you believe that he...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">CLIENT: Right, and so he's like, and the answer is that God's mysterious. He's like, when good things happen, God is good. When bad things happen, God is mysterious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah, you don't see the intentions, [his intentions] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">CLIENT: Right, yeah, and this is the answer. [0:27:54] The answer's like, why do bad things happen to people? It's like, oh, God is mysterious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">CLIENT: It's like, well, yeah, or not involved...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">CLIENT: Or not involved. And then when people are like, well, why are people...? People wouldn't be good to each other without religion. No, people would be good to each other without religion. They would. People have been good to each other before even religions that had moral codes in them. It's just <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B1\">more like, well, Thor's going to fucking blow up your house with lightning if you don't put some offerings on that. Shit, Thor blew up your house with lightning. Yeah, you must not have done the offerings right. I guess not. Better luck next time. Whoops. Worst case scenario, this guy keeps fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B2\">up with [Thor offering] (ph) as you can by his exploded house. Maybe he should leave, lest Thor blow up all of our houses. Could I get a reference? No, no you could not (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">THERAPIST: (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">CLIENT: See what some other tribe has to say about you. Yeah. [0:28:55] So... (Pause) And (pause) so, I mean, again, this reminds... assure me that I'm being irrational in my fears.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">THERAPIST: Yeah, they're irrational.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">CLIENT: You think so?

I mean, I don't know... then again, I don't know anybody that doesn't get a little freaked out when something like that happens. But are they going to come after you? No, (inaudible at 0:29:21).

I was looking for 18-year-old models. [0:30:55] And I thought a good search term would be nubile. I thought that was... because that means at marriageable age but also young? And this one place was like, oh, Nubile World or whatever. I'm like, all right, doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF1\">some quick searches, it seems to be safe. It's not a malware site as far as I can tell. That's good. So I click the link. They're like, important, everyone here is 18 years or older. And that very sign on the front page, I was like, I don't want to be here anymore. Anything that comes on that very first <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF2\">page, like, hey, important, this is totally legal. I'm like, okay, I don't think I should go to that.

If that's a concern you guys have...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B5\">THERAPIST: That means there's a chance that it might be there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B7\">CLIENT: Right.

Well, let me ask you this. Do you have...? I mean, if you set aside the concerns about kind of a Big Brother watching kind of thing, what about...? Do you find yourself concerned...? Do you find yourself looking at yourself going, what am I doing? Is that...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C3\">CLIENT: Sometimes. I'm like, why am I risking this? [0:32:55] Why am I continuing to search in Google for these things? And... because very quickly it gets really shady. I'm like, I'm just looking for some nice pay site, where you subscribe to some site, and they're like, there's all these naked 18-year-olds. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201C31\">I'm like, ah, that'd be great, thank you. If you don't find that on the first page, then there aren't any safe ones. And [one of the best things] (ph) you can do now is go one step further back and doing a search for porn site review sites.

[0:33:58] And then boom, now we have you, which makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201CB1\">good sense. And it seems like also an incredibly stupid thing to do...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CF\">CLIENT: Go on the net and try to buy illegal things.

So (pause) again, I guess that's the thing. What I'm really afraid of is accidentally seeing the wrong thing. And that's... there's an easy way to avoid that, is just staying near the road.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh, yeah. [0:34:55] Although I guess there's a curiosity I imagine not just about... you're saying not the kind of the exciting aspect of being involved with something kind of dangerous.

Okay, authenticity. [0:35:53] BDSM porn, which is really evolving into even stranger and stranger things. But what is interesting about it is the reaction of pain, where that is real. That is real. That happened. That's why <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201F71\">there's so much porn which is obviously fake. There's noises and everything.

Yeah, $3000 seems worth 45 minutes of work, or in many case 20. [0:37:55] So that's interesting. That's certainly interesting.
