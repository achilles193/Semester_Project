So both Jennie (sp) and I have gotten in a car since I think last, and driven sort of. Jennie (sp) is going away for a conference, the first time she, or I, has been away since Grayson was born. I\u2019m not certain whether the best thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">to do is, I think I\u2019ll probably get, we\u2019ll have a babysitter who can spell me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">I\u2019ll also probably be pretty tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: You talking about Thursday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sort of deliberating over whether to cancel on Thursday, and we should probably, I mean, you need me to make the call soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: When\u2019s Jennie (sp) leaving?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Leaving tomorrow morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I mean, it\u2019s basically, the issue is basically kind of how I feel, and if it goes fine, you know, we have two friends, we have a friend coming to stay the night along with me, so it\u2019s not\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Right. Where I\u2019m going is I had a couple cancellations tomorrow morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Oh, I see what you\u2019re saying, so we could substitute tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: She\u2019s, yeah, that\u2019s probably not going to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: She\u2019s, she\u2019s leaving at 11:45, so she\u2019ll probably leave, it depends upon the morning, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: The earlier one is at 7:45.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I think that sounds good. I would like to consult her, and make sure she\u2019s comfortable with that logistically. I have to take the car to the auto repair anyway, so that actually might work fine. Let me give you a, call her as soon as I get out of here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: No problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Then I could give you a ring. Failing that, I probably, you know, if we don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s probably safest to cancel, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Because, you know, I don\u2019t want to leave it to the last, can\u2019t leave it to the last minute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: So\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Let me just write that down here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: So we\u2019ll cancel it now. In other words, we\u2019ll cancel it now and then the open question is whether tomorrow morning works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Right. That\u2019s the twenty-seventh. Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I had a good talk with my sister about a strategy for, I had a couple of good talks. I had a good talk with Jennie\u2019s (sp) stepdad, I may not have mentioned. He wasn\u2019t like enormously helpful, but you know, it\u2019s like every time I sort of verbalize, vocalize my kind of perception of, you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">what I\u2019d like to be doing and where it\u2019s going, but it feels a bit more comforting, it seems a bit more mine, you know. So and I had a nice talk, very nice talk with my sister.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: So, I mean, I guess I\u2019m a little worried about, sense this, a little bit, as I set up my set of obligations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">I\u2019m not sure that, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m fumbling a little bit for how I want to express these things, but the long and short of it is I feel worried about fucking up. I feel worried about letting Jennie (sp) and Grayson down, and sometimes I displace it onto someone else, like Jennie\u2019s (sp) dad calls on <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">Sundays, and I spoke to him briefly last Sunday, and he was a little grumpy, and you know, I kind of displaced this worry about myself onto him. And I talked to Jennie (sp) afterwards, and she said, \u201cYeah, he was really grumpy. I\u2019m not sure what is going on.\u201d So, in other words, you know, I\u2019m aware <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200452\">of not being a judgment that is external to me, and yet that\u2019s the way it sometimes manifests. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562142\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable at some level, and I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t yet feel troubled by it. I will if I\u2019m still having difficulties sending out all the resumes and stuff in a couple months, but for now, it just, I\u2019m just kind of noticing it. Yeah, I feel worried about letting my family down. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">I feel a little bit, you know, Jennie (sp) and I had a decent talk cut short, as might be predicted, by the baby waking up. We put him down for his nap, talk, and it lasted twenty minutes, but it was a good talk, and I think we kind of got done what we needed to get done, and we\u2019ll certainly do it this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">evening after he goes to bed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">But the kind of, basically what we said was, what I said was, you know, I need fifteen hours a week during business hours, and you know, I need flexibility to do stuff on the weekends. That\u2019s my work. You know, which includes both the employment stuff, you know, five hours a week for employment stuff, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">you know, which maybe that\u2019s a gross underestimate, but it\u2019s cut and paste, ought to be okay. And then ten hours during business hours for them, and so, you know, we figured out how to get babysitter, you know, for that time so, you know, I can actually maybe in the mouse, maybe, you know, in the cafe <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200492\">or nearby, whatever, have that certain type of work. And it was not, it was not a difficult conversation. I realized that Jennie (sp) is sensitive to some of the resentment that I was feeling when she kind of, you know, anticipated and was bending over backwards a bit to do stuff that I\u2019ve been carrying <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200493\">on in general, you know. It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s nice feeling that, you know, mutual support in our relationship. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">Yeah, so, you know, whatever anxiety I had, I guess, that we discussed on Thursday, is interesting in its own right, but it wasn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t, the kind of worst-case scenario was (inaudible at 00:07:31). interaction. It was sweet, actually, the interaction, it was nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: It was sweet. But, you know, I do find myself kind of reflexively feeling some stress about just being kind of subordinated. You know, the stress about Jennie (sp) having a place and me not having a place. Stress about being, you know, cast in the role of this kind of you know, servant, or facilitator. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">Of others, including my son, you know, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a rational feeling or one that I can endorse in any kind of reflection, but I feel it, it\u2019s palpable, it\u2019s me. I think those are the two sort of emotional, I don\u2019t know, the high emotional notes right now on the downside, on the cost side <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">of the balance sheet. You know, on the other side of the balance sheet, Grayson had his four-month checkup today and this is my birthday today, and yeah, the physician was very effusive, the pediatrician, she\u2019s really nice, we like her a lot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">And she was just, he was smiling, and it was pretty sweet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Oh, that\u2019s fantastic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: So yeah. It\u2019s good. I sent my uncle the very concise synopsis of that stuff I dug up. And he didn\u2019t know anything about it, nothing. And, you know, again, I think it\u2019s probably relatively significant that episode on his mother\u2019s side, so it\u2019s kind of interesting. He\u2019s going to put me in touch. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">There\u2019s apparently a Providence branch of the family, so if he\u2019s in touch with one of the cousins, so we can fill up the family tree. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562142\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">He as, he seemed very, like he rarely responds very quickly, and he wrote me back from his phone like half an hour after I had written it, so it was very, it was a nice interaction. We\u2019ve been starved for those. It\u2019s funny, in my, we have a box of family photographs that I hauled out after Grayson was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">born, and he\u2019s in a large number, he was a really big presence from like ages, I don\u2019t know, one to five or so, as he\u2019s working (inaudible at 00:10:49). He\u2019s less, he was always observant, you know, but anyway, he\u2019s in a lot of pictures, and I think those that he\u2019s not in, I think he took, so you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\">I mean, after he had his own kids, it\u2019s natural, and I think he and my father were close at the very end. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">But there was this religious thing dividing us, and one of the interesting things about that episode is how multigenerational this probably, probably this is a primeval phenomenon, if you think about it. But I don\u2019t know, it was nice. It\u2019s nice. I mean, I think, my sister is in Pittsburgh as are they, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve had much contact, so it\u2019s not that they\u2019re not cordial, but it\u2019s difficult. So it was nice to have this exchange.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Oh, good. I think you\u2019re feeling sort of in a way, kind of more open about, and less avoidant of the work stuff than sometimes in recent months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019m getting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s obviously, like talking to more people, and feeling good about (inaudible at 00:12:12). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah, no, I mean, these have been dates that are longstanding, so if that\u2019s true, and I wouldn\u2019t say I talk to a lot of people, and I did talk to a couple of people completely unproductively right after, right after I quit, and the (inaudible at 00:12:28), so I don\u2019t know. I mean, I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">better about it. I don\u2019t feel as fucked up about it at the moment. I think the concept of, you know, getting something very low-key and having projects work that I\u2019m doing that\u2019s unrelated feels very sound and appealing to me. You know, something in the admissions department, whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">You know, something, not grunt work, but something that I wouldn\u2019t be bothered leaving at five, just completely forgetting about it. You know, basically if we want to say in Providence, so this is a calculation, and you\u2019re the third person that I\u2019ve vocalized this with. You know, if we want to stay <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">in Providence, getting an academic job is almost impossible, but if we stay in Providence, then, it happens to be very wealthy and institutions and admissions department stuff, you know. And the reason college tuition is fifty thousand dollars a year is because you involve all these superfluous, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">know, administrators. So why not exploit that? Anyway, that\u2019s the (inaudible at 00:13:53). You know, and the fact is that the academic job market is so fucked up for that very same reason, because they\u2019re only hiring adjuncts, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">So whatever. It\u2019s like, you do the market analysis and say, \u201cOkay. Well, let\u2019s be on the right side of that.\u201d And the other side of that is that they say, I don\u2019t know, we still have not yet completely unraveled the mystery of why I feel so fucked up about the intersection of vocation and you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">employment, but there\u2019s something there, and it feels as if, you know, sort of circumventing that by having a, you know, remunerative, minimally remunerative job that does not feel like the alpha and the omega probably would be an advantageous strategy to take. You know, I have the qualifications to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">make that not a completely, you know, obnoxious subordinating, subordinated position. So theoretically, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to go. You know, maybe I just have to take pot luck. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562142\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">But at any rate, that\u2019s, yeah, that\u2019s my thought process, and you know, see which of the hundred institutions in the Providence metropolitan area wants to hire me. So, so that is my current working conception. And, I mean, as I say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: What frightens me a little bit is I don\u2019t know what went into your thinking about being in an admissions department in particular, but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Ah, that\u2019s generic, but maybe there\u2019s something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, whatever. I guess what I thought was interesting is like you\u2019re reading people, doing applications a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah, you mean, something that was difficult for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Maybe, yeah. Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: I mean I guess, again, this is not, that was purely meant to be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">Like there\u2019s a funny joke that this pomophilosopher (sp) makes. He says, (Latin), which is like, whatever, something, a Latin phrase that many philosophers going probably back to the Romans have used, means, it\u2019s translation means, I am a grammatical example. Not my name is Grayson, but, rather, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">I am a grammatical example. So that was not meant to be substantive, it was merely to be a grammatical example. But, you know, you know, assuming that there is something to, you know, these kind of Freudian slips, I think that, you know, in narrative terms, that\u2019s probably the most interesting part <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B2\">of the administrative side of, you know, of academia, is admissions department. It\u2019s like you have the most contact with the, I don\u2019t know, just the sort of poignant and interesting, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">Decisions get made there that, you know, they\u2019re consequential, that really have meaning for people in their lives, and we read about people\u2019s lives, and people\u2019s essays, and that\u2019s quite frankly, as I think about it, I haven\u2019t done so before, but does, it sounds like that could be cool. Anyway, it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">yeah, so we will see. We\u2019ll see if Jennie (sp) ends up wanting to stay in Providence, stay at MSU, anyway. There really, the other, I mean the other remote possibility which we\u2019ve begun to discuss is whether we can wangle a spousal hire at MSU. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">Which would be and off, you know, like a fast-tenure track. That\u2019s not something I, I didn\u2019t really want to keep her, I\u2019m not sure how far that would extend, but we\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m glad they want to keep her. That\u2019s a good thing, I would imagine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. No, she\u2019s gotten a lot of nice validation of that sort. They know they fucked up with the maternity leave, and something like this obviously has the potential to make somebody pretty significantly so. Yeah, I feel less fucked up about it than I have in a long time. I haven\u2019t yet <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">done anything about it, mind you, so maybe the fucked up feeling will return. Again, I have this kind of sense of foreboding that, you know, that whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562142\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: It does seem to me, as you said, you haven\u2019t of that many people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, or anybody outside my family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: Right, but it does sound a little more opened up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Possibly. I mean, I guess, yeah. I guess, I mean, at some level, this inquiry or inquisition into why, what in the hell is going on is a little bit academic, as it were. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t, you know, I keep on coming back to this episode where I was on the stairs at the (inaudible at 00:19:50) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B1\">library. I don\u2019t know what to say about it, and I don\u2019t know how to get at it, you know? And it just feels like such a, you know, such a kind of primeval mystery. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">I would like the, this process between us to result in having at least some better understanding of what it is. You know, we can talk about it, and have, and do talk about its dynamics, sometimes ad nauseum, I\u2019m sure for both of us. But what\u2019s up with that? I don\u2019t know. So I guess, you know, at some <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">level I am impatient with requests to kind of have everything cut and dried. At some level, I really would kind of like to have at least a useful working hypothesis. But at the end of the day what really matters is, you know, that all of us in our household, Grayson included, are you know, appropriately <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D2\">employed in the things that we\u2019re supposed to be doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">The pediatrician gave him an A plus in baby. We were very pleased about that.

Yeah, you know, that\u2019s kind of at this point, the proof of the pudding, that\u2019s the eating, the eating. Eating is not really kind of this inquiry, but it sure would be nice. It would be nice, nice to have a (inaudible at 00:21:45) to it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">And basically, if, you know, I were to find a good situation, I would feel like we\u2019re done, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">And yet, if we were done and you know, we were still kind of in the dark about what was going on, I\u2019d feel a little funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: What is it in particular about what you would feel in the dark?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Just kind of weird. The level of distress, the degree of contradiction and inhibition, and the amount of disruption that it\u2019s caused, whatever it is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure, maybe that\u2019s what this novel thing is for, just to come up with a plausible scenario. It doesn\u2019t really matter if it\u2019s the right one, the extent that that\u2019s a meaningful project, maybe those are the two projects. Maybe that\u2019s where this parallel project kind of really spoke of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">complementing our interactions. Maybe that\u2019s where it comes in. That\u2019s plausible. I haven\u2019t actually really started writing like all the work that I\u2019ve done has been more along the lines of kind of planning it out, and you know, you could do that ad infinitum, really. My sister said during the course <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F2\">of our conversation, \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019ve got a novel too. I never write anything down, but I think up a plot and this and that and the other thing.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562142\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">I\u2019d like to be a little bit more productive than that. Maybe it\u2019s not important. I think it is somehow. It\u2019s important to write down one scenario. Like when it\u2019s not written down, you have every scenario, like every possibility, is superimposed on all the others. You know, it\u2019s like One Thousand and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">One Nights. (Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">(Long pause continues) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">(Long pause continues)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess. Right, well I think that\u2019s kind of very often the thing for you. I mean, with, I think the writing provides a pretty sort of clear example where you suggest like the issue isn\u2019t as one might expect it to be coming up with one narrative that seems just right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">For you, you know, there are many narratives superimposed on each other, and the issue is overcoming the kind of passivity and inhibition that seems to keep you from actually doing the writing in the first place. And that tends for you to come from worries about either worries about doing something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A91\">for yourself that\u2019s in your interest but maybe not enough. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">And the interests of the people around you, or in reaction to feeling like something isn\u2019t really for you, and it\u2019s really for somebody else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not clear on the difference between the two of those. Worries about\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Well like with you have felt at moments, this is sort of the most recent iteration of this, like, you know, Jennie (sp) hasn\u2019t been, you haven\u2019t felt this all the time, but there have been a few moments where you felt like even though you\u2019ve been skeptical that it\u2019s you and not really coming <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">from her at all, that she\u2019s sort of taken her work more seriously and not sort of made enough space for your work and this and that. I know this is not what you said about the conversation today, but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: I was feeling that last week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Right, and that yeah, and I think some other point, and you know, that kind of pushes a button for you. I mean, and then the other one is more like your worry that you mentioned today, of failing, fucking up, letting Jennie (sp) and Grayson down, not being there for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: The second order problem caused by the first order problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I actually think they\u2019re two different, well the question are they two different problems or are they the same problem?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: I\u2019m worried about reacting to the first problem by, with a response that makes the second problem. I think, I mean, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess that is. I had been thinking, you know, that one is a mom problem, the other is a dad problem, for similar shorthand. You know, like, you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve had this thought at various junctures myself, so I can proudly insult you for posing it. But it does sound very Freudian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: But yeah, you\u2019re right, I think it can kind of mix together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Well, you know, as mom and dad mixed together to create me. Well, yes. That is, I think that\u2019s kind of our working conception. So I\u2019m a little lost on\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Why I said that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Well yeah. I just kind of got lost. I\u2019m a little tangled up. So what does it mean that these things are, these are the two problems? Oh, that\u2019s right. these are the two things that get in the way of, for example, writing. Kind of inhibition and lostness in space and time that comes about as <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">a result of at least intersection of these two anxieties. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562142\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">Which may or may not be kind of causally implicating each other. Yeah. I mean, one difficulty is that because I\u2019ve always had this, at least, you know, in my non-early childhood amnesia induced failure to recall. You know, I\u2019ve always had this difficulty, and you know, in some sense I just never sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C71\">of had the experience of not having it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">You know, it\u2019s always been a struggle, you know, looking back to a very early age, so not having had the experience of failing to struggle with this, I have habits, you know, I have habits of mind, I have, you know, kind of process that\u2019s sort of been defined and articulated and so on by these inhibitions. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C91\">And so it\u2019s a little like learning to walk again, I guess, trying to figure out what it would be like to avoid them. I don\u2019t know what it would mean, and, you know, among, I have the, probably not very productive conception, a fantasy, or something, that you know, that I\u2019m very, my creativity itself <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C92\">is somehow the product of the tension between, you know, one and the other. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">Or that, you know, the struggle against this particular set of inhibitions. If I didn\u2019t have, had the inhibition, you know, it\u2019s like I wouldn\u2019t have any juice. I\u2019m very open to the idea that that is not a very useful way of looking at things. It sounds a little like the, you know, the fantasy of alcoholic <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB1\">writers not being able to write if they don\u2019t have booze. But, you know, they in fact may (inaudible at 00:33:42). Hemingway didn\u2019t have that, you know, not having delusions of grandeur, but you know what I\u2019m saying. You know, it\u2019s like, did he, would have had a difficult time writing if he wasn\u2019t drinking, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB2\">so I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what to make of that, but I do have that conception somehow. I just like, you know, just putting it in the kind of less kind of, you know, question (inaudible at 00:34:03). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">I just don\u2019t know what it would be like not to have this, not struggle against it. Not to, you know, like there are kinds of habits of mind and process that seem almost certainly to really be, you know, for example, just gathering a whole bunch of\u2014And you know, some of it is like natural cognitive style, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD1\">and some of it probably methods that I developed to, you know, kind of deal with the fact that I just get really scattered when I\u2019m in the grips of this anxiety. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just musing. And Jennie (sp), let me just divert the conversation to something more concrete. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">So Grayson\u2019s growing incredibly fast, and one thing that means is that he\u2019s outgrowing, you know, the massive, unbelievable number of clothes that we\u2019ve received. We bought like five outfits or something, and we have like I don\u2019t know, a hundred, and so he\u2019s outgrowing them, and periodically we need <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF1\">to sort them and figure out what actually fits so we don\u2019t have to cram it in the drawer. So you know, I said, \u201cI really want to do that this week before you go, Jennie (sp).\u201d And knowing that, well anyway, I said I really want to do that. And so what I did, and this is completely typical of me, is <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF2\">that I took all of them out, and I laid them all out on the bed, and I sorted them, and you know, I don\u2019t know, fleecy things with feet, and the fleecy things without feet, and the, you know, fleecy things that are just, whatever. There were twelve piles, and I said, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s do it tonight.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562142\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">Well, needless to say, we didn\u2019t do it that night, and so I put the piles aside, and then we had to do something, whatever. So this is I don\u2019t know, five or six days ago, sitting in these piles, all of his clothes in two piles ever since then, and Jennie\u2019s (sp) like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just do it bit by <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D11\">bit? Why do you have to take it all out of the drawer?\u201d And this is, she knows that this is my method, and she knows that I\u2019m very efficient when this happens, but it makes interaction between us very difficult. Now my, we\u2019ve talked about this, I believe. You know, this aspect of my cognitive style, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D12\">and you know, when I was a kid, you know, my room would be really messy and then I would take everything out, you know, put it in the middle and kind of distribute it to the places where it went. And it\u2019s very pervasive in various, you know, kinds of projects. I always do this. Gather, gather, gather, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D13\">gather, put it all in the middle and then at some point, you know, I distribute it to the proper place. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">And I think we\u2019ve talked about it in terms of just having a lot of chaos and looking for some kind of strategy to manage chaos whether you think about chaos as, you know, external to me and our family or you know, in my head, you know as a product of, in part of these tensions that you\u2019re describing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D31\">this tension that you\u2019re describing, you know, over these things that I\u2019m anxious about. But you know, I think we\u2019ve talked about it in terms of, not just sort of the you know, who knows what goes into some of these native cognitive styles, but it\u2019s a way of managing a kind of disorder, or sense of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D32\">disorder, or feeling of disorder. But at this point, you know, that\u2019s kind of the way I think. That\u2019s kind of the way I write. You know, it\u2019s kind of the way that I do all of these things. So what would it be like not to have the things that have produced it and the things that it was kind of natively <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D33\">designed, in some sense, to you know, to, the environment that it was designed to operate? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">I feel, I don\u2019t know, would even function properly? Would I dispense with it, and if I dispense with it, what would replace it? And if nothing replaced it, then would I be able to write at all? Would I have any creative process at all? It feels like, you know, my creativity, and what\u2019s unique and interesting <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D51\">and characteristic, at least, about, you know, what I do is bound up in it. And at some level, I guess, that also means bound up in the inhibition. You know, bound up in the disorder, which might also explain in part why it\u2019s been so durable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">Are you following, or have I (inaudible at 00:39:11)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s, no there\u2019s something that I\u2019m not following. I think I get what you\u2019re saying about your cognitive style. The piece that I\u2019m not following is so, like with the clothes, it doesn\u2019t sound\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">CLIENT: What\u2019s the chaos?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Well, it doesn\u2019t sound like there was a problem. I mean, there\u2019s a problem that you involved in together go through them, but there was not a period of inhibition as I, here. I mean, you know, you decided you wanted to do this, you sort of went about it in your way, you didn\u2019t wind up having <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD1\">time to do it, but I haven\u2019t gotten a sense from what you said so far, that you\u2019re like, you know, sitting on it for three weeks and frustrated and tense and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562142\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">CLIENT: And there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, per se.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean that sounds different to me than like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">CLIENT: I see what you\u2019re saying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">So in some sense, it might a very evocative example. It\u2019s not an example of what I intended it to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, that\u2019s why I was asking, because I didn\u2019t know that there was some way that it was that I failed to understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">CLIENT: I mean, I guess I\u2019m bringing it up now, not because I particularly thought it through in particular, but because right before I came here we had that conversation, and so\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Another example would be you know what you said about your writing process. Again, maybe there\u2019s something I\u2019m not understanding, but you know, in a way you do. You basically pile everything in the middle of the room, and then I assume you kind of organize it and put it where it goes, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB1\">that. That doesn\u2019t sound like a problem. I mean, the problem, as I understand it, it when you can\u2019t do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">CLIENT: I guess what I\u2019m trying to, and yes, this is helpful. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that I feel in some sense like I keep, like at some level, and I\u2019m kind of keeping the inhibition with me on the assumption which as you point out, maybe, you know, countermanded by all of these examples, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED1\">keeping it around on the assumption that I would just not be me if I didn\u2019t have it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">At some important level, which sounds like again, kind of like this classic, classic instinctual rationale for, you know, kind of keeping a vestigial developmental defect. I don\u2019t know. I mean, I don\u2019t know what to say about it. It\u2019s like what, it\u2019s like what psychotics who won\u2019t take their meds say, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF1\">you know. It\u2019s like yeah, exactly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think it\u2019s like what somebody who\u2019s manic says. You know, well, I mean, it\u2019s really part of who I am. I don\u2019t want to tamp it down because then I wouldn\u2019t feel like me, if that\u2019s what you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Psychotics who don\u2019t want to take their meds often say, \u201cWell it\u2019s the meds that\u2019s causing the psychosis.\u201d That\u2019s why I was confused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">CLIENT: Oh, I see. Okay. Well I defer to your clinical judgment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m just trying to get it straight in my head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">CLIENT: Manic depressive\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">THERAPIST: So I guess there\u2019s something that feels linked between inhibition and then putting everything in the middle of the room and organizing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. That is definitely true. And, you know, like who knows whether I\u2019m just stretching. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">But, you know, we put off doing the sorting for a long time, so maybe it wasn\u2019t my own personal inhibition, but it was definitely in my mind in a response to our household not being able to get it together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">THERAPIST: Okay, so I think I see the light more clearly now. So, for example, with your writing, with the novel, you might say that you\u2019re in the getting everything together phase now, and you\u2019re worried that you could remain at that phase forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562142\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20105\">CLIENT: Phase, you know, ad infinitum, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20107\">THERAPIST: And never sort of get the story organized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah. write the story out, and choose from the, you know, the various possible adventures, yeah, definitely.

All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, just think about tomorrow morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, let me give Jennie (sp) a ring and see what she\u2019s feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">THERAPIST: And if that\u2019s not good, we\u2019ll be next Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">CLIENT: Next Tuesday, yeah.
