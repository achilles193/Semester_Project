BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
As for bumps in the road at times, largely due to her being very busy in her life and due to her daily experience often being dominated by the issues of her intense nerve pain, she did not do some of the assigned homework following some of the sessions, or did it lightly, or made some last minute 
effort in order to please me (the therapist). We discussed these matters in a productive way. Also, for a time she was not clear about the distinctions between two aspects of the ABCDE technique (namely between the (D) 'disputing' and (E) 'effective new philosophy creation' steps). This was probably 
due to her not having/making time to more thoroughly read material I had given her about them or to question me more fully about them in earlier sessions. By the final session, she seemed to grasp the differences with more confidence. She intends to continue to read about them and REBT in general, and 
to continue her ongoing practice.
