TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: So starting on Friday. Yeah I definitely. I’m trying to think of a word I cannot find. It’s so weird for like a week now I feel like there’s a word I’m trying to think of to describe how I’m feeling. Not deflated, defeated, just I cannot its weird.
THERAPIST: Discouraged.
CLIENT: Discouraged something yeah, I’m just like Something like Friday I went out to have a drink with my friend Matthew and my friend Isabella. It was just, it was funny. I mean in a way the whole bar was symbolic. Maybe there’s just a mood out there like the bar was kind of empty. It was unusually 
kind of empty. Everything just seemed blah, like the rest of the crowd kind of seemed blah. I had like one beer, two, I was like I did not even feel like drinking. Wasn’t sitting well with, I wasn’t feeling good. Since I started feeling kind of nauseous on Friday. I felt like I was having trouble making 
conversation. And since them I’m just like. It’s been. 
CLIENT: I just don’t know like, it’s like I don’t know what to say anymore about these things, you know what I mean? It could be it’s like it’s now getting into the dead of winter, and it’s just cold, and on top of everything else I’m just exhausted. I don’t know, I feel very lethargic. I have just 
been feeling really tired. I have been sleeping a lot. At 1 minute I feel like I’m gonna be fucked for the rest of my life, and the next minute I feel kind of hopeful. Like it’s just this. 
THERAPIST: What is this, fucked for the rest of my life?
CLIENT: I just feel like. I mean I feel like, you know. That I have to get used to the fact that like this is it, you know. And that like coming here, I mean this is great, and it’s good that I’m working on things. But I think I have hit a wall with myself. Where it’s like dude you’re either doing shit 
or you’re not, and you know you’re not 20. You’re not even 30. So you either are writing your book or whatever these things are that you have hopes for. Or you are just not. And if you’re not you’ve just got to make peace. You’ve gotta be just like you know what? Maybe I just want to sit around and 
watch Netflix all day, and I just don’t care anymore, or I don’t care right now or whatever. 
CLIENT: Like I can’t you know. So I’m having trouble psychologically, you know it’ not working with me anymore. No man you’ve gotta give yourself a break, and. I mean I am giving myself a, I mean it’s hard to explain. Like not that I should be whipping myself all day. But I just feel like if there are 
these things I have hopes for, I’m either diligent, not just half-assed, but diligently working to make these things happen or I’m not. So that’s you know that’s a pretty big you know. Now the flip side of that is. I mean I’m kind of am. I mean I’m recording an EP, right? So I am diligently working, 
you know. So the flip side is I also have to be able to give myself a break in terms of not comparing or not. Yes I wished I worked on this EP when I was 25 or, you know what I mean? But I am doing it, you know? 
CLIENT: Or too separate working on something with monetary or validation from others or I don’t know. So there’s 2 different kinds of, on one hand I feel like you’re either doing it or you’re not, and that’s I’m getting a little tired of making excuses to myself. On the other hand it’s like this, you 
know what I mean? It’s a weird combo of like I kind of need to be a little harder on myself. But in a certain way, and not in other ways.
<span data-id="P1-N2001A-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: And not as hard on yourself in other ways.
CLIENT: Right! So that’s kind of not easy, but. So there’s that. I feel lonelier than I’ve ever felt in my life. I think that’s also what’s happening. I just feel really lonely, like melancholically just, you know. And that’s depressing me. I’m like so what am I doing? I’m talking to this chick in Armenia, 
what does that mean? I’m gonna go there and she’s probably not gonna be someone I want. I mean I can’t, that’s really just depressing me, I can’t even, you know? 
CLIENT: I, I don’t know. That’s just really, really making. Maybe more than anything that’s really making me feel whatever that word is that I’m looking for, defeated, or de-. Like yeah, or like this is it. Like I can’t even find, and whoever I have hooked up with. Either I have just immediately, you 
know just hook up and I don’t want to see them again, Or the 1 or 2 times I kind of want to see someone again, they don’t want to see me. So it’s like what is happening? Like just. I don’t know. 
THERAPIST: [inaudible] leading up to how much loneliness there’s always been.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: All along when there aren’t as many sort of surface exciting, impulsive fillers.
CLIENT: Yup.
THERAPIST: Right? Like masturbating [inaudible] the peaks and valleys and when you start taking some of that away and you come back to ordinary life. And your ordinary baseline state has been a tremendous amount of loneliness, even in your own family.
CLIENT: Yeah. No there’s no doubt I think that’s what it is. I think it’s like a yeah.
THERAPIST: You feel lonely when you’re all alone half the time [inaudible].
CLIENT: This has been happening since Friday. See that’s the thing. Like I go down to see my Mom. I take, and I just can’t talk. I literally I’m just like. In those moments I’m just like what the fuck am I doing here? You know? Or I don’t know if I think that, I just. She’ll just be talking about some 
bullshit thing, and she knows that. I mean my mom is not stupid. She knows, and she’ll be like, you know. She’ll try to be I mean she is sweet in that way. She’ll be like talk, it’s healthy to talk. What’s going on? She knows, I mean I can’t hide in front of my mom. 
CLIENT: But it’s like say what? Where do you start? I mean I can’t with someone who you know is not quite gonna get it, or feel defensive or whatever the fuck she’s gonna feel. It’s just. I don’t know.
THERAPIST: For someone who is not [inaudible] recognizing you.
CLIENT: Yeah, she just does not. Yeah. It’s like she wants me to be well, but she doesn’t understand or wan to understand the reasons I might not be feeling so great at different times, you know? 
THERAPIST: What do you get when a critical and anxious paranoia. It’s your. When I was thinking the other day about you once told me about a way she would respond to you having a cold.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: In a kind of fretting, why you almost like what did you do to get this cold. Like kind of cold.
<span data-id="P2-N2003C-dsp"></span>

CLIENT: Which and now take that and imagine it in the whole family.
THERAPIST: In the whole family.
CLIENT: They do it to each other, they do it to themselves. I don’t know where or how I got.
THERAPIST: it’s not a personal insult. It’s not anything you did wrong to get a cold.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: Ever. But it’s so like you know another way like when I say Claire looks bad, and you think that’s really, really horrible.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well she did it like 2 nights ago. I got home, and I was kind of in a good mood you know. I was excited; I kind of get excited to see her get excited when Cecelia comes down. She gets so; it’s just great to see my mom like that. She just loves this critter so much, you know. And I can 
see that brings her joy, you know. 
CLIENT: So I get kind of excited to just watch that, whatever. I come and I sit down. I’m okay. And like she says oh you know. She reads a lot of like health books about like roots, and vegetables, and herbs, and that’s great. She’s like you know son I was reading the thing and they were talking about 
natural things you can do for redness in the face you know? Now you know it’s like dude I’m sitting here.
THERAPIST: [inaudible]
CLIENT: Yeah. She doesn’t you know, she doesn’t mean it, but it doesn’t matter whether she means it or not, it’s just they can’t help but do that to themselves to other people, to anyone in the family. Like my aunt telling my grandmother, the woman has dementia. She’s 90. You know just telling her like 
you know. Oh man you wanna tell this to your psychologist friends. They were laughing, mostly my aunt, but my mom too that supposedly my grandmother’s nose is getting longer. Its changing shape, and they were kind of making fun of that.
THERAPIST: Oh my God. (chuckling) 
CLIENT: You know it’s like a 90 -year-old woman sitting there with dementia dude, what the? Are you kidding? I was like well, you know that’s you know that as you get older your ears and your nose they do kind of change because it’s gravity, and you know. But it was just so like. So that’s what we are 
talking about. Forget about me. Like that’s their mother. That’s a 90 -year-old old, ill woman and that’s what they have to point out, you know? So.
THERAPIST: [inaudible] 
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: I think that’s the part of the joy of watching her greet Cecelia is like she can feel [inaudible] she never [inaudible] towards you.
CLIENT: No. Yeah no.
THERAPIST: Like madly in love, like not
CLIENT: But wait, but wait, wait, wait, but she does. Cecelia just doesn’t understand. Oh she does.
THERAPIST: She does it to Cecelia?
CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. She makes a big thing about like when there are other people around; she wants people to know that Cecelia has very blue eyes. But that she’ll be like I don’t know, at night they’re dark, but you should see they’re so. Yet she wants people to know this cat has blue eyes. 
They’re very blue. I’m like mom; you know they’re always blue. I mean who cares, but it’s just like what are you even saying? So like they literally change color at a certain hour? They’re just blue. Sometimes it’s dark out and they are darker. It’s a cat you know what I mean? Or she’ll be like is her 
face kind of dirty? It looks darker than usual. Or I don’t know, to the cat. Yeah to the cat! 
<span data-id="P3-N20064-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: No wonder. It’s a physical preoccupation.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: An obsessive eye and she’s like trained you into being this attentive to there is something wrong in my body.
CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: When there’s not! It’s normal. It’s a cat!
CLIENT: Yup.
THERAPIST: It’s a kid.
CLIENT: Well not only that, it’s the most beautiful cat I have ever seen. So like nothing, you know what I mean? I could stroll in there with Brigitte Bardot and I have. I have, you know the most, and like oh this one is like this. The teeth are too bright, whatever, you know. Oh she is so beautiful, 
be careful you know guys are always going to be pursuing her, whatever.
THERAPIST: That’s cruel.
CLIENT: That’s devastating. What do you do? You just can’t unless you are going to completely excommunicate your family it’s very, it’s a lot to deal with. 
THERAPIST: Well it also means you never got to really be
CLIENT: Never.
THERAPIST: Assume at being seen and being one with [inaudible].
CLIENT: Well you know why because yeah when you’re alone. Let’s say I’m alone and watching Netflix, right? I’m relaxing, but whatever I’m seeing I can’t help it right? If I’m not careful I’ll watch a movie, and in the movie I’ll go to these places about these people, and these characters, and life and 
you know. You know what I mean? If I’m not careful I’ll project her idiotic world view you know. So yeah, I don’t know. So I think all these things. Like I’m just hitting a bit of a wall where it’s like. 
CLIENT: Yeah I don’t know what to do. Yeah I just don’t know what to do. Like Uma, that was another one. There was the divinity girl, then this other girl, then Uma, the one that had sex with the guy. Like there has been like 4 women in the last like week that, I’m not even madly in love with any of 
them, but it’s just been a weird. It’s almost like cosmically it just happened to synch up with the week where I’m just feeling shitty about unemployment, and just like. And Uma was like you know I can’t do this. You know you’re like a. I mean it’s not a bad thing. She was basically saying like I know 
this feeling I’m having, which is I’m kind of falling in love, and it freaks me out. But I also know that
THERAPIST: This is Uma from?
CLIENT: Delaware.
THERAPIST: Delaware.
CLIENT: Yeah. So it’s like I don’t know how to respond. It’s like I’m so, I don’t even know anymore what I’m doing, you know what I mean? 
THERAPIST: So she said she’s kind of falling in love?
CLIENT: She’s like I can’t continue to pursue you because it’s just hurtful, like it’s just really painful.
THERAPIST: She’s really into you.
CLIENT: Yeah. It’s like distance wise I have really, really strong feelings, and but it is what it is. I can’t make you you know, whatever. But what I’m saying is like I don’t even know how to react really to that. I was like, oh I’m sad or whatever. Was I sad? I don’t think so. I’m more numb, you know 
what I mean? Because I can’t even tell anymore, like this has fucked me up so much that which one is worth pursuing? I don’t even know. You know what I mean? So. 
THERAPIST: [inaudible]
CLIENT: And now that I’m so lucid about these things right? I’m just not sure anymore which, I don’t know.
THERAPIST: [inaudible] has also hasn’t been wounded to feel like, to know which relationship is right. You’ll moan and [inaudible] not have to suffer.
<span data-id="P4-N20098-dsp"></span>

CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know? Like that’s a I said to you before like. The few times I said that you looked sad, and you look horrified like that’s a bad thing that I would be saying that, as if that’s a weakness or something being pointed out. Or like there’s something wrong with you, instead of that being 
something that could feel good. Like Oh someone gets it.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And it’s like someone sees me, someone knows me. It’s safe to feel happier. You’re so prepared all the time for someone to view something in you that’s not good.
CLIENT: Right. 
THERAPIST: So how in a way could you know even, which of these women is a place that you could be at home, and feels comfortable.
CLIENT: Right. But you see that’s the problem. Like what do you do with that information? That’s really depressing because like well the months are flying by, and what I’m gonna wait until I kind of figure that out, and settle down with someone when I’m like 51? You know what I mean? And that’s one, 
and two recognizing that fact just it’s like an avalanche of partial regret but just an avalanche of all these past relationships, you know? Which I have found in the last week I’ve been really yearning. I want to reach out to Kelly. I wanna, you know. 
CLIENT: I know that’s not good. That’s not, like I know what that is, you know what I mean? I just feel really lonely and this and that, and (pause)
THERAPIST: What did you suffer through, when she said that to you?
CLIENT: She’s great. I don’t think I’m in love with her, you know? I think she’s awesome, but see that’s what I’m saying. In some ways why shouldn’t I be in, you know what I mean? She’s pretty. She’s into a lot of the same things I’m into. She really likes, like she really cares about who I am, and 
wants me to be happy, and like. So like why don’t I?
THERAPIST: Why you think?
CLIENT: I’m not sure. I think that. I mean I worry a little bit that it’s because of that. That she is so open and so loving that remember I think we talked about that one time. That is almost like a turnoff in a way. You know? So 
CLIENT: But then there are also. I mean some of it is just realistic. I mean I don’t have two nickels to rub together to. I mean, you know I mean I’m really broke. So what’s that? What she’s just gonna drive up here every weekend? That’s great, but that only makes me feel kind of guilt and like we’re 
keeping tabs like well it’s only fair like I should be going. I don’t feel like it. I can barely get outta bed, like I.
THERAPIST: Unless she was here then.
CLIENT: Well if she were here it wouldn’t be this dramatic. You know what I mean? She would be a girl I was hanging out with, and we would have function, and you know what I mean? I’d just see what happens, you know what I mean? It wouldn’t be it wouldn’t have to be all this thinking about it. 
CLIENT: But yeah. I mean even if she were here I don’t know, you know. There are just too many layers, I think. This is the problem that’s just making me feel really deflated about this. The shit with my family, and my mom, all that. Then the past relationship stuff, and all that. Not having any money. 
But then also I don’t know how real this Assyrian thing is. You know? Like it’s just. So it makes it pretty much impossible for me to do anything. (pause) Speaking of which. So I last night, or whenever, it was like 4 in the morning whenever it was. I spoke on the phone with the English department. 
I’m still not entirely sure why I can’t get an official offer. But it turns out that’s kind of the way they do it for most, most people who are not hired as full time, you know what I mean? Adjuncts, other people like that, lecturers, whatever. This is how they do it. And she’s just like the Dean is 
a lawyer, and he is very paranoid about like you know if we offer you a thing, and you are not here. We offer it, we’re kind of committing, and then if at the last minute you decide you’re not gonna come we’ve really allocated, and now you’re not coming. Just some of that, you know? That being said. 
I think I get that, I think I get that. That being said, she was like you know I mean, basically between you and me you should come here. There are plenty of courses. We would probably start you off with at least 1 but probably 2 courses. They pay double what they. They pay like $4,300 a course, which 
is not what I expected at all. So I’m mean 2 courses, that’s what I thought 4 courses was gonna be. 2 courses, I looked up the rents, $500 bucks for a pretty nice apartment in the city center. 
<span data-id="P5-N200B8-dsp"></span>

CLIENT: She’s like and she’s like other than that there’s just plenty, once you are here. She’s like there are just a lot of opportunities for someone like you. She’s like if you come earlier there might be some summer classes. She’s like those don’t pay as much, but you could do that. There’s lots 
of tutoring. There’s just, she’s just like there’s a lot of stuff to do. And then she’s like you know so like in the Fall you know I think like expository writing, but then she told me. She’s like in the long term we have plans for creative writing, for Literature, and that kind of was my thinking, 
that once I’m there at the early stages. I mean they don’t even know me. Once I got there and they know me, and blah, blah, blah. That could be my thing. 
CLIENT: So I basically told her I said yeah, I mean, and then I tried to kind of, because I cannot get anything in writing. I kept trying to like if I commit then I’m at least gonna teach. I mean I’m coming there to teach. I’m not coming for these other peripheral jobs. You know? So it’s something I 
still want to clarify, but it’s pretty clear.
THERAPIST: Like even finding out what she would say about by when you needed to be there, and you could be pretty sure of guaranteeing at least 1 open course in September. You know what I mean? 
CLIENT: Well she’s like you know obviously, you know. I wouldn’t go there in August. Because yeah again it’s about them knowing that you’re here. Okay so we can know. So in her mind she’s like just let me know when you’re gonna be here. We can start straight away, like there’s plenty to do, even before 
the summer if you get here. So what I told
THERAPIST: In other words at the very minimum to be there before the summer in order to guarantee something in the fall.
CLIENT: During the summer.
THERAPIST: During the summer?
CLIENT: During the summer, yeah. Because what I told here was I was like by the time. I did not want to tell her that I am broke, but, you know. And it’s a big deal, I mean for example what am I gonna do with Cecelia? That’s I mean, I don’t know. I don’t know if I could leave her here. That’s, I have 
never had a connection like this with anything so, you know what I mean? I might have to take her with. I mean it’s a long journey but. 
<span data-id="P6-N200C8-dsp"></span>

CLIENT: I mean leave her with whom? My Mom and a bunch of nut jobs, and have my grandmother accidentally throw her something that she is gonna choke on? I don’t know, I just don’t. I worry that she’s not going to be taken care of the right way. My mom loves her, but she loves her, I don’t know about 
her being there 24/7. And that’s a little thing, but it’s not a little thing. I mean that she has changed my life. I love her, you know so. I mean it’s not the end of the world, people move with their pets all the time. But I’m just saying there are, that’s an added expense.
THERAPIST: You’re taking in the reality of what a
CLIENT: What a move would mean. Yeah, yeah. And not just that, yeah I mean here, and friends. I love that, I mean I do love it here. On the other hand, this isn’t like going to London. That’s what thing I’m reminding. You know what’s funny? I was gonna tell you this, when I moved to London. I still 
was so in a coma. Remember how like when I left? It was as if I was never gonna come back. You know what I mean? 
THERAPIST: Umm hmm.
CLIENT: And that’s just such an awful way. It saps the excitement of it. Instead of being, I was excited, but I also, it was so dramatic, you know? It’s like yeah it kind of is, but it’s a 5 hour flight.
THERAPIST: Well there’s another way it would become a sort of, another sense of not having an integrated memory of yourself. It’s as though once one thing is over you’re into the next thing, then you’re only in that next thing instead of it being like yeah it’s a part of your life that you went to London, 
but you have this whole other life here. It’s still part of your life. It’s not going anywhere.
CLIENT: Right, right. Right.
THERAPIST: That you come back too.
CLIENT: Right yeah, and well this all start with San Francisco right? When I went to San Francisco
THERAPIST: Yes!
CLIENT: I did not come back I think to visit for 2 years or something. As fucked up as I was I somehow didn’t, and even then for like 10 days or something. I mean. Anyone else would just be coming and going and you know I miss Darien so I just wanna go visit. You know what? I wanna go to Darien for 
a month. Then I’ll come. 
CLIENT: Like there was no just fucking weird. Again I don’t, it doesn’t compute now when I think back on it. So that’s one thing about Assyrian, it is really exciting, are you kidding? I’m gonna go there; teach at the university, awesome experience. Possibly a long term relationship. And then I’m gonna 
get what I want, which is to be able to come and go. The Cecelia thing, yeah that’s a complication. That’s an added expense, and I feel bad dragging a critter, you know. I know that for animals it’s not easy to travel, and she’s such a housecat. She’s not like a, but that’s a minor inconvenience I mean. 
So yeah I’m trying to remember the what, all day like what? What? I’m not gonna like it? Then I’m gonna come back. 
<span data-id="P7-N200E0-dsp"></span>

CLIENT: Nothing is gonna change here, I’m gonna be in the same situation. Minus an apartment. Fine, whatever. So I don’t know. So as it stands now I don’t see why I wouldn’t go. I don’t I mean. I would have to find some amazing job here. Now how I’m gonna get the money to do any of this, that I don’t 
know that, but I do need find something maybe. I need to make some money or whatever to be able to go. Because they don’t help with relocating, no they don’t help with that. You are getting hired. It’s as if you already lived there, and you are getting hired as an adjunct. You know what I mean? That’s 
how they are doing it, you know. 
CLIENT: And she was honest, she was like that’s how I got hired. She was like I was here already. My husband was working in, so she was like I was here, they hired, and in the beginning I did a lot of. Like she was kind of trying to tell me like you know we are kind of gonna use you a little bit, you 
know? She was like I kind of work.
THERAPIST: [inaudible]
CLIENT: Yeah she was like I did grunt work. Sometimes I worked kind of for free. You know like I just. She’s a chair of the department, you know? Not that I want to do all those things but I kind of see what she’s saying. I mean it’s not the states. It’s a make shift, it’s a totally different mentality 
and way of doing things. When she called me she was laughing. She’s like I figured I would call you now, because you seem like a night owl, and I’m a night owl, we’re all night owls over here. You’re gonna fit in just great. Like great. But umm. So yeah I don’t see why I wouldn’t. I have friends there. 
I have 
THERAPIST: What if you were to get a similar kind of offer [inaudible] but the possibility of doing the same exact thing here.
CLIENT: For that money?
THERAPIST: Umm hmm.
CLIENT: That’s not bad. I mean I have never found an adjuncting job that pays over $2500. This is almost like double that.
THERAPIST: So let’s say you did 3 courses a year, would you want to stay.
CLIENT: I’d think about it, you know the difference is let’s say I did that right? It’s Darien, that’s no money. That’s no money. That’s the problem here. There I feel like, I cannot help it. I’d feel like wow its Armenia, so I am kind of doing something for something that is connected to my heritage. 
That is the reality of that. But also that I am being savvy. I’m getting my foot in the door into something; I know 2 of the Deans for Christ’s sake. You know and now I know this woman. My friend Irene works there from Middletown. I just feel like there’s something about it that seems like a very opportune 
THERAPIST: That’s what I’m asking. It’s not just that you would make money there.
CLIENT: No, no.
THERAPIST: Assuming you could get the same job at some point here
CLIENT: It can’t be about money, this can’t be about money. I’m gonna find some job doing something. I’m applying to sales jobs now for Christ’s sakes. So I’m gonna make a lot more in sales than I am. No it’s about everything. It’s about, I think going there, even music wise. What I think is things 
could happen there. Now what is that? It’s a tiny little country, so big whoop, you know, but sometimes it starts with a little thing like that, you know? Here you’re just lost in
<span data-id="P8-N200FC-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: Well you know what could happen is that [inaudible] I mean that’s something too.
CLIENT: That’s huge. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No that, but I mean even music wise, like I think it could be the next level of what I’m doing here, kind of coming into my own and really kind of. And then once you are in Armenia, over there it’s different you know? Then it’s not that big of a deal to fly to 
Istanbul to give talk, you know? In other words I think things would really open up. All these places that I love, well 3 hours here, 4 hours that way. Two and a half hours that way. I don’t know. 
CLIENT: It’s, yeah I don’t see a big risk in going, you know? The worst that would happen is that I would get there. It would be okay, I’d maybe not let’s say like the people as much or something, you know what I mean? So the worst would be I’d be like all right I did it for a semester. It’s on my resume, 
it’s a great experience, and it’s not for me, you know? 
CLIENT: And then what’s happening here anyway? I’d come back and pick up where I left off, but now with more teaching experience, and that’s a nice international. It’s an university you know sort off.
THERAPIST: Maybe you would have time over there to finish your…
CLIENT: Well that’s, and that’s a whole other thing. I think maybe it would kick start the way I was in London, you know?
THERAPIST: Exactly, so they can get that [inaudible] at the end of that loan. Get that done with.
CLIENT: Yeah, yup, yup.
THERAPIST: And then, just how it opens the horizon, at least in that realm as the backup plan.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then I could start applying anywhere.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: To real faculty jobs. Yeah, yeah. No I’m hoping that, I mean I think in general I’m hoping for like kind of what I felt in London over Britain, just to kind of energizing, you know. That’s just such a great feeling. Those feelings I have had over there, so.
