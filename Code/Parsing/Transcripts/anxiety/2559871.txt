TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: Experience of looking at your watch. The other person can’t look at your watch. (Pause) Is that not it? (Pause)
THERAPIST: I guess we’re kind of right into it. (Pause)
CLIENT: We’re kind of right into it? [0:00:57] I don’t know what that means. You want an introduction or something?
THERAPIST: (Laughing)
CLIENT: (Chuckling) Taxiing? Like an airplane taxiing?
THERAPIST: I think you’re teasing me.
CLIENT: No, I’ve wondered why you don’t wear a watch. But yeah, I’m teasing you after that. I don’t like wearing a watch either.
THERAPIST: [Don’t want to feel it on you] (ph)?
CLIENT: I don’t like things impeding my hands. And I don’t have a great relationship with… I don’t have a great relationship with time. [0:02:01] And wearing a watch makes it worse.
THERAPIST: Hmm. (inaudible at 0:02:07) (Pause)
CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:02:32) (Pause)
THERAPIST: What do you want?
CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:02:57) (Pause) [0:03:02]
THERAPIST: How? (Pause)
CLIENT: I want you to be available more? I want the attention. (Pause) [0:04:00] (inaudible at 0:04:41) (Pause) [0:05:00] [0:06:00] [0:07:00] [0:08:00]
THERAPIST: What’s on your mind?
CLIENT: [My mind] (ph) wants to think about you all the time. It’s conflicting (ph) (pause), hard. (Pause) [0:08:57] I don’t know it that well, even though it’s like it’s there all the time. Sort of hard to observe, hard to describe.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:09:18). (Pause) It’s sort of similar to how I… my mind will sometimes wrap around planning (inaudible at 0:09:45) making dinner?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:09:57]
CLIENT: It’s like something will come to me spontaneously. And then it will just sort of proliferate and mix and form in my mind. And I really have no control over the process, but I think about it a lot. I think about doing it. And I imagine myself doing it, imagine how the colors look and… for example 
last night I bought pea tendrils and beets (ph)? [0:11:02] And I went to the daily sitting. And the Jay thoughts and the pea tendril, beets thoughts were really similar in how they just sort of had their own velocity, their own speed.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:11:36) about the pea tendril thoughts is that that’s sort of a productive unit? It’s like… my mind is full of these images of how the pea tendrils look and how they might taste and how they might taste with lemon or lemon zest. [0:12:01] And are the beets sweet? Are they… should 
they be cooked? Should they not be cooked? How would they go together? What else might go with them? These aren’t questions. It’s just the thoughts are there. It’s like, almonds, lemon zest, no lemon zest, cooked, not cooked. It’s all (pause) things forming. And then I have dinner ready in my head. 
And I go and execute it, and it’s so beautiful and satisfying, though there’s something about that process that I also don’t appreciate that much, because it’s also nice to just be spontaneous, and not have premeditated dinner.
THERAPIST: I see. Uh-huh. [0:12:56]
CLIENT: But it feels spontaneous in the moment, it doesn’t feel like I’m…
THERAPIST: When you’re thinking about it or when you’re sort of dreaming about it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Thinking seems more conscious and intentional.
<span data-id="P1-N20042-dsp"></span>

CLIENT: Mm-hmm. So the thoughts about you are really similar.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: They’re not conscious or intentional. And there will be little productive units. A question will form I’ll think a lot about or be in the space of that question and looking (inaudible at 0:13:41).
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause)
CLIENT: It’s very afflictive… [0:13:59]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Because it… I don’t know why it’s afflictive. It doesn’t get (inaudible at 0:14:11).
THERAPIST: Well, it seems to me there’s a lot of longing in both.
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) There’s a lot of conviction (ph) in both, too, but it’s playful.
THERAPIST: Conviction in what way? I mean, I can see how in cooking you have confidence in what you’re doing or how you might prepare things. (inaudible at 0:14:57)? [0:14:59]
CLIENT: Yeah, there’s sort of, I want this, I want to know this, or I want these two things to go together, or… yeah, like it’s right.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:15:23)
CLIENT: Yeah, I really [want both] (ph). (Pause) But that I want you is hard.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I don’t know what to do with it. It’s hard to feel (ph) it. [0:16:00] (Pause) (inaudible at 0:16:35) a very clear role and purpose and anticipation of creating something or building something.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:17:00] Well, and satisfying sometimes.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: There’s multiple things.
CLIENT: What?
THERAPIST: Multiple things. (Pause) (inaudible at 0:17:28).
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. I used to ask my mom in the morning what we were having for dinner. (inaudible at 0:17:48). [0:17:56]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I imagine among other things you feel close to her. (Pause)
CLIENT: Yeah, I feel close to myself, too. THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah, there’s a pretty strong tradition of fantastic… I don’t know, just a devotion to dinnertime and cooking well and cooking every day in the family, not just the women. My grandfather, my dad’s mom and dad did it, too. So I guess there is a collective sense of being close to that in me. (Pause) 
[0:19:00] [0:20:01] I started crying last night. Jeremy is working on a music track. He was working on it when I wanted to go to sleep, and I invited him to come to bed a couple of times. He sort of didn’t answer me, the way he does when he knows he should go to bed but he’s not going to. So I went 
to bed and sort of felt the weight of the longing for you (pause) and didn’t think much of it. [0:21:03] But I just called Jeremy on his phone, and I was going to ask him… I don’t even know, I think I was just going to ask him to come to bed one more time? And I start crying on the phone. And then [he 
said I sounded sad, but I didn’t know I was sad] (ph) (inaudible at 0:21:44). (Pause) [0:22:00]
THERAPIST: Oh. (Pause)
CLIENT: But I didn’t cry with him in the other… in person. I didn’t (ph) cry by myself when I was lying there. (Pause) So now [something came out when I asked to help] (ph), like a desperation or (pause) (inaudible at 0:23:04). [0:23:06] (Pause) [0:24:00]
THERAPIST: Is what it feels like a bit here where you want me to come to bed, and I won’t, and you feel alone. [0:25:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Maybe, yeah, alone, being left alone. (Pause)
CLIENT: Still this comes up sometimes. It’s… the motivations are really different. Jeremy won’t come to bed because he’s in the middle of a creative process for himself. You won’t come to bed because you’re trying to (inaudible at 0:25:53) the creative process for me. [0:25:59]
<span data-id="P2-N2007E-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: I mean, yes, that’s literally true. But I imagine it feels like I’m just off in some silly head space where I think there should be things like boundaries and creative processes.
CLIENT: Yeah, it’s hard for me to get behind sometimes.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: Most of the time.
THERAPIST: I would imagine so, sure. (Pause)
CLIENT: I mean, I have some sense of perspective.
THERAPIST: It operates at different levels.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, you know in your head what I’m doing and why. On another level (inaudible at 0:26:56). [0:27:00]
CLIENT: It just seems… (Pause) It seems mixed for you. I think there’s a part of me that thinks, if I just try a little more to bring the part of the mixture out that doesn’t come out (inaudible at 0:28:55) (pause), it will feel better. [0:28:10]
THERAPIST: You mean to draw me out?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Or… I don’t know how much I try to do anything. But sometimes it feels like… one way in which I experience this is, I’m sort of waiting for you to come out, is the whole point for me.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Or I’m waiting for me to shift… or not waiting for anything, but conditions, missions shift all the time. [0:29:03] And sort of letting… or… I don’t know.
THERAPIST: It’s suffering, you’re afflicted.
CLIENT: I’m afflicted, but sometimes it feels like I’m working on understanding you. (Pause)
THERAPIST: With the thought that, once you do, in a way I’ll be available or I will be right there with you?
CLIENT: Yeah, but I’m not so focused on the destination. [0:29:58]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: It’s more each morsel of [you that I get to know] (ph) (inaudible at 0:30:12) sense of relief.
THERAPIST: Hmm. (Pause) Do you know in what way?
CLIENT: Well, in one way it’s satisfying to operate within your… on your terms an still feel like I’m getting to know you and am important to you and moving to you. [0:31:10]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So in that sense I’m just realizing how special that can be. In another sense I’m trying to rip all those boundaries away so that it goes faster, goes on my terms, or so that I throw you off (pause), cause things to be stirred up in you. [0:31:58] (Pause)
THERAPIST: So in a way it’s kind of something (ph) in its own right, in that you have a little more of a sense of who you are to me?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: And in another way it also sort of makes you feel like you have more of a hold in a way, that you could tear all the boundaries down and (pause) get me very stirred up in a way that I couldn’t control or something? [0:33:11]
CLIENT: I don’t know. (Pause) There’s so much (inaudible at 0:33:27). (Pause) [0:34:00] You’re watching me?
THERAPIST: Hmm?
CLIENT: You’re watching me.
THERAPIST: I was thinking, there’s a paper where the guy writes about dreaming sort of from the (inaudible at 0:34:42) we’re talking about. [I was wondering if you’d find it interesting] (ph). [0:34:57] There’s not any huge insights. It’s just… (Pause)
CLIENT: Sure.
THERAPIST: His name is Thomas Ogden, and I think the paper is called Three Forms of Thinking.
CLIENT: I’ll get it. (Pause) I used to read a lot about anything that came… it described what I felt about you? Five or six months ago I used to read a lot [to know] (ph). And that… it’s interesting how that framing (inaudible at 0:33:57) I feel like I could write so much about it myself… [0:36:01]
<span data-id="P3-N200C2-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And much better than anybody else. (Pause) And I don’t feel like I know it at all. It’s so hard to understand and get a handle on it. So…
THERAPIST: Well, I mean, that’s one reason it’s good to free associate, because, in a way, I think what you’re saying is that you’re a bit sort of defended (ph) against what it’s really like, if that makes sense (inaudible at 0:37:01. [0:37:04] It can be hard to bear to let yourself really know some 
things about what it’s like. And that’s one reason free associating can be helpful, is because, when you let your mind go like that and just say stuff that seems random or off topic or probably not connected or it’s really not that important or kind of inappropriate or whatever…
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: It becomes clearer later how, without realizing it at the time, you’ve said things kind of indirectly that you couldn’t quite let yourself say directly. [0:38:08]
CLIENT: Yeah. I can do that. (Pause)
THERAPIST: I guess… (Pause) I don’t want to give you the impression that I am not interested in what you have directly to say. [0:39:03] But I think we would probably hear more of what you have to say (inaudible at 0:39:09).
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)
THERAPIST: And also [congratulations. It would be more further surrender to this process] (ph).
CLIENT: A lot of times I draw a blank when I’m here? [0:39:57] So that’s interesting.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I think it’s too seductive or something. Not you or me, but both of us and the whole thing is too distracting and seductive.
THERAPIST: Maybe it’s difficult to talk about what that… some of what that feels like. I mean, you do talk about what that feels like. But maybe there are some things that are also hard to say, and not the… maybe things you consciously decide are too uncomfortable to say. But I suspect it’s much more 
so things that are there but don’t sort of get to the point where you’re aware of them… [0:41:02]
CLIENT: Yeah, I don’t…
THERAPIST: And aware of being uncomfortable about them.
CLIENT: I…
THERAPIST: I don’t think you’re consciously withholding.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:41:18)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I’m aware of there being a whole lot of space that’s usually filled up with stuff when I’m not here.
THERAPIST: Yeah, right. (Pause) [0:42:00]
CLIENT: The question has come though… I have a lot of questions always.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: So that’s a form of free association that feels acceptable (pause) or not contrived.
THERAPIST: I have a sense that there’s something that feels a little sad and maybe submissive when it comes to… when you think about free association.
CLIENT: No, I think of it as being an intensely uninhibited and creative process that requires a little bit of creating room, which I don’t feel like I have here. [0:43:07] Sort of like, sometimes when we start on rehearsals for the Afro (sp?) weekend, we were rehearsing in the pitch dark. That probably 
doesn’t surprise you. And that helped me a lot, and it seemed to help the other people, too, a lot…
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Especially in interactive improvisation.
THERAPIST: It makes me think a bit of… I mean, the sort of traditional arrangement of free association is not looking.
<span data-id="P4-N200FC-dsp"></span>

CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah, but you look at me.
THERAPIST: Sort of. Kind of yes and kind of no, actually. [0:43:57] I don’t sit like this when someone’s lying on the couch, because I usually face more that way. I have my notes open. I can see you and sometimes will turn. But it’s not the same.
CLIENT: My first reaction to that is that I’ll lose you if we do that.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: I’m not sure why I feel that. (Pause) [0:44:57]
THERAPIST: [That sounds very sad] (ph). (Pause) In some ways you would. In other ways you wouldn’t. What I have in mind in saying in some ways you would is that you wouldn’t see my reactions in the same way.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (Pause)
THERAPIST: I’m probably a little easier to catch off guard this way. But I don’t think that’s actually a big deal. [0:45:57] I mean, it feels like a big deal, but…
CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:46:02)
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:46:04) I’m not trying to say what you should do, but…
CLIENT: That helps a little.
THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) give you some credit.
CLIENT: Yeah, let’s try it next time.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:46:27)
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:46:29)
CLIENT: That’s what I’m saying is, I want to try it next time, but I don’t know what it’s going to feel like when I actually show up.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:47:00]
