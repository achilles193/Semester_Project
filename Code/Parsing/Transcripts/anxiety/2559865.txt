TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Hey.
CLIENT: Hey. How’s your day gone?
THERAPIST: Pretty good. (Pause) How about you?
CLIENT: Pretty good.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: I look forward to this (inaudible at 0::00:32). Stirs up thoughts, though, coming here for me. (Pause) [0:01:01] Stirs up so much (inaudible at 0:01:05).
THERAPIST: [In what way] (ph)?
CLIENT: Actually I didn’t… I sort of engage in this biking meditation on my way here. So I’m very aware of it, that I’m sort of (inaudible at 0:01:38). I’ve been sitting at the Meditation Center every day this week, which I haven’t done since I started going there last year. [0:02:01] And that has been 
really different and cool…
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And hard. (Pause) Hey. (Pause) Does the Yale PPO reimburse you $150 per session, for 24 visits a year?
THERAPIST: No, the… which one, the student insurance? [0:02:58]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: What do they do?
THERAPIST: Things are changing, but it’s… let’s see, I think they were reimbursing $55…
CLIENT: $55?
THERAPIST: Yeah, the idea was some of the students… [for somebody] (ph) in network the rate’s about $90, so they reimburse about…
CLIENT: Oh, [so the co-pay’s] (ph) $35?
THERAPIST: Right. (Pause)
CLIENT: Oh, I don’t think I paid any of those co-pays.
THERAPIST: Last year?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It’s probably because you were recording.
CLIENT: Oh, maybe.
THERAPIST: Maybe you were recording?
CLIENT: I didn’t start recording that soon.
THERAPIST: Oh, really? Then? Hmm.
CLIENT: I could be wrong.
THERAPIST: Okay, I can check. [0:04:00] Doesn’t matter.
CLIENT: So why is the HMO out-of-network reimbursing you $150? That shouldn’t be happening.
THERAPIST: No, it shouldn’t. It’s probably… let’s see, they… all right, there are a few things. Let me back up. So I [recently heard] (ph) where they are processing the latest request form…
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: After I sent it to them.
CLIENT: Yeah, I call them once a week.
THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) Yeah.
CLIENT: [And it ended up they hadn’t gotten from] (ph) (inaudible at 0:04:53).
THERAPIST: Right. They have now, and they have sent it to get processed. [0:04:58]
CLIENT: Huge improvement. THERAPIST: Yes. So my guess is that… there’s a little form, a little thing you can check off that says, will you accept the in-network rate, which I did check because it made it much more likely they would pay?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: But they said yes, and then they weren’t paying me the network rate. So I don’t understand why.
CLIENT: Okay. So the employer PPO would reimburse you $75?
THERAPIST: It would depend what the co-pay was, but yeah, it would be $75 per visit. I mean, I could… actually what they would do… if we were on our current schedule, they would do probably $90 minus the co-pay for Monday. [0:05:54] And then I would bill them for a longer session. You can bill for an 
hour session, but that’s the longest. So I bill them for that for Thursday. And they reimburse I think probably… might be $150 minus the co-pay?
CLIENT: Why can’t you just split it up into two…
THERAPIST: Hour-long?
CLIENT: Two 45-minute-long sessions, and…?
THERAPIST: Actually, I think I probably could. It’s a good question. In the past you didn’t… you couldn’t do that because they wouldn’t let you go for more than one per day.
<span data-id="P1-N20066-dsp"></span>

CLIENT: So can you bill for… we didn’t meet on Thursday twice. We met on Thursday, and we met on Friday.
THERAPIST: That I could do, but that I wouldn’t do, because… it might be fine, true. But what I might be able to do now, because they’ve changed the codes, is… you may be able to do that now because now it’s the same code whether you see somebody for individual or family? [0:07:01]
CLIENT: Uh-huh.
THERAPIST: So I could just bill for the same code, and they’d never know that it was two individual…
CLIENT: And somehow that untruth is better than our other untruth?
THERAPIST: Sure, because they… it’s not like they check or it’s their rule that it has to be individual and family. But that’s why they made the change to allow it, because it could be. Yeah, actually, that’s what I would do.
CLIENT: I don’t know what’s going to happen. But it’s good to know all these (inaudible at 0:07:38).
THERAPIST: Got you. Is… open enrollment is not until…?
CLIENT: November.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: My little attempt to get money from financial aid failed, but they were very nice. [0:07:59] Basically unless we’re going into the red they can’t give us anything (ph)…
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Which is far from happening.
THERAPIST: Right, good. I mean, obviously not in terms of (inaudible at 0:08:14) but not being in the red.
CLIENT: Yeah, we are not.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: We are saving a lot.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: But I did find out from my insider scoop that Yale might be bumping up their (inaudible at 0:08;33).
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: But don’t tell anyone.
THERAPIST: I won’t tell anyone.
CLIENT: So that could make it different for me with regards to joining Jeremy’s PPO, or it could not.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: It would have to be double the number at least for it to be slightly equivalent. [0:09:05] But it’s still not equivalent. The problem with joining Jeremy’s PPO is that it only works out for us if I see you for the whole year, for ten months out of the year I think it was, or something like that. 
(Pause) And, considering that it feels like it’s been two weeks since I saw you on Monday (pause), that’s a ton of time. So I’m not really allowed to talk about it at home until several months from now, but that was where we left it. Well, that’s not where we left it. [0:10:04] Where we left it was, 
Jeremy doesn’t want to tell me what to do. I should acknowledge and respect that there is a lot of time between now and open enrollment, and I will make the right decision. And Jeremy knows that I will make the right decision. (Pause) (Chuckling) What’s going on?
THERAPIST: I guess I had a practical thought, which is, in the decision, it doesn’t sound like the options are that different. I mean, it sounds like… it’s not nothing, but it’s probably a few hundred bucks one way or the other. [0:10:57]
CLIENT: What, to join the PPO or not?
THERAPIST: Yeah. That sounded like the decision you were referring to.
CLIENT: Not if Yale sticks with 24 sessions.
THERAPIST: Right, in that case (crosstalk).
CLIENT: Then I couldn’t tell you what it is, it’s like $4000.
THERAPIST: That’s how much it would cost to join the PPO?
CLIENT: No, that’s how much it would… it would cost $4000 more to see you at the… [at this] (ph) rate with only 24 sessions. Do you want to…? Can I pull it up?
THERAPIST: I’m happy to look at it, sure, but…
<span data-id="P2-N200AA-dsp"></span>

CLIENT: I’m not sure that that is so important right now.
THERAPIST: Okay, yeah. I… my hesitation was not at all… I’ll look at whatever you want. But yeah.
CLIENT: I don’t think… I’m very proud of what I had to do… [0:12:01]
THERAPIST: (Crosstalk)
CLIENT: To submit to the financial aid people. So I would like to show it to you. I would like to show it to anyone. But it’s not what we should do. (Pause) So sitting a lot has (pause) made some things clear (inaudible at 0:12:48). I think I am feeling really hurt by you (ph). [0:13:00] (Pause) (inaudible 
at 0:13:10)
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (Pause) (inaudible at 0:13:51) I have some thoughts as [to what happened] (ph). What do you have in mind about…? [0:13:59]
CLIENT: You were withholding. I mean, I know it’s a matter of perspective, and maybe you are very openly generous and bountifully giving as a result of some of the withholding. But maybe it’s necessary for other stuff to happen. But, I mean, it doesn’t feel like it really matters what intellectually 
it is. It’s very hurtful.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause)
CLIENT: That’s all. (Pause) [0:14:59] That huge, big mountain of things is all. (Pause) [0:16:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, so I guess that what I’m trying to think through is (pause), while I understand what’s made that hard to see, what’s making it hard now to talk about, given it’s (inaudible at 0:16:30).
CLIENT: Why are you saying that it’s hard to talk about? (Pause) [0:16:59]
THERAPIST: Because it seemed to me like you almost sort of caught yourself there when you said, that huge thing, that’s it, that you had just sort of… as though if you hadn’t qualified it that way it almost would have (inaudible at 0:17:23) not necessarily being so huge or…
CLIENT: Yeah, I don’t know. I… when I hear, that’s all, that just doesn’t seem like an appropriate thing to say. So I was qualifying it because… I mean, what I meant to say is, that’s what I had in mind or something. (Pause) [0:18:00]
THERAPIST: [I think] (ph) it’s very hard to be talking to the person who’s being so hurtful about how hurtful I’m being, and…
CLIENT: It hasn’t been so far today. Do you want me to say more? I really don’t have… I mean, I could describe the feelings, and I could describe times that it’s more hurtful. But (pause) (inaudible at 0:18:48).
THERAPIST: I think the piece that you were just saying that it was really… recently as you were sitting that it became very clear… [0:19:05]
CLIENT: Okay. Maybe I can tell why, and it will become more clear.
THERAPIST: I mean, I just [want to understand it] (ph), yeah.
CLIENT: I think the withholding… you were withholding, and we talked about it a lot. It’s hurtful that you won’t hug (ph) me.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And it’s hurtful that you don’t confide in me. (Pause) And it can be hurtful that you don’t get in touch with me between sessions. (Pause) [0:19:57] It is hurtful when it seems like there’s a lot of emotion for you, [and only a little bit of it comes through] (ph).
THERAPIST: You mean, describe, or do you mean…? CLIENT: Yeah, described.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause)
CLIENT: Yeah. I think what’s become clear is how much occurs, not what the things occur.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: But I’m carrying around… I’m carrying a lot of hurt around.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [0:20:57]
CLIENT: And maybe before I was frustrated, or I… annoyed or whatever.
<span data-id="P3-N200E2-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: Yeah, no, that helps me understand, and it also fits with how we were talking I think on Monday. (Pause)
CLIENT: What in particular?
THERAPIST: From Monday?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You were [talking about how it’s hard to say] (ph), and I asked you about it (crosstalk).
CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah, that’s totally what… I mean, it’s still hard to say, but that’s what makes it hard.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And (pause) just being at home is not working right now. (Pause) [0:21:59] So… also I wasn’t really… and I was devolving into not affected (ph), though some of those things were really straightforward to change, because I’ve been… in some ways [I think it improved a lot] (ph), but it still (inaudible 
at 0:22:20). (Pause) But it feels totally different. It feels totally different to go to community sitting, to sit for 45 minutes, which always inevitably gets shaved on one end or the other at home. (Pause) [0:22:54] Yeah, (inaudible at 0:23:00) and to just decide, I’m changing this, just the [kind 
that will push] (ph), stop floundering and start thriving for (inaudible at 0:23:20). And I went to the… they do this beginner thing on Tuesday where there’s a bunch of guidance and walking and sitting. And I sat yesterday and went to the dharma (sp?) talk after that, which was so heady. It was really 
heady, but it was a neat talk, not so much about practice at all. [0:24:01]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So all of that helps, too.
THERAPIST: What’d it feel like when you were sitting?
CLIENT: Well, it kind of felt like, oh! Kind of felt a little bit liberating. I’m totally hurt all the time, over and over again. (Pause)
THERAPIST: That’s very horrible. I don’t mean…
CLIENT: It is horrible. I guess it feels horrible, but I don’t really understand what’s horrible about it except for how it feels. [0:25:00]
THERAPIST: That’s what I have in mind.
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Yeah, how painful.
CLIENT: It’s not unjust, even though it feels that way sometimes?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And that added a lot to the suffering, to go around thinking, this isn’t right. But when I’m just sitting a lot of that goes away, and it’s… (Pause) [0:26:00] Yeah, [so I’ve had a hard day] (ph).
THERAPIST: Do you feel it very physically? Do you (inaudible at 0:26:17)? Does it feel like grief? Does it ever go away? (Pause)
CLIENT: I don’t think I know yet. (Pause) I’m sort of trying to not have a lot of distraction in my vision (ph), because it helps me feel it more. [0:27:08] (Pause) I don’t know. [0:27:59] Maybe you can ask me again another time.
THERAPIST: Some other time? Sure. (Pause)
CLIENT: It feels really stable, so… I don’t know. (inaudible at 0:28:38). (Pause) [0:29:00]
THERAPIST: Stable also in that it’s grounding to be in touch with what you feel?
CLIENT: Yes. (Pause) I think I’ve spent a lot of time trying to alter the natural course of a lot of things. And I don’t think I really know what it means to let something take its natural course. And this uniquely feels like I am letting it take its natural course. [0:29:58] So I don’t know (inaudible 
at 0:30:03). It’s making it clear how [not the natural course] (ph) (inaudible at 0:30:26), then… (Pause) This is coming from this quote that was shared last night with [the pastor and Chad] (ph), which is something like, try and let go, and let things take it’s natural course. [0:30:57] And I heard 
that. I was like, what is that? What is the natural course? I don’t think I’ve paid much attention to that ever at all.
<span data-id="P4-N20116-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: (Chuckling)
CLIENT: (Chuckling) Natural course equals what I want, and then it happens.
THERAPIST: (Chuckling)
CLIENT: But that’s really hard when you don’t know what you want or what you want changes or what you want doesn’t happen. (Pause) These days it mostly feels like I just have no idea what I want, and what I want isn’t happening. [0:31:57] (Pause)
THERAPIST: I guess a big part of what you wanted and the heartbreak was that (inaudible at 0:32:26)…
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Not withholding.
CLIENT: That’s maybe the only thing that feels really clear with what I want in my life. The rest of it feels like that primitive darkness of scaring or (inaudible at 0:32:59) changing what I want so I could… I have no idea. [0:33:04] I can’t… I’m so used to waking up and having all these things that 
I want every day and going and getting them, or not getting them and reacting and learning. And that’s much harder now, I mean, [for some of that] (ph).
THERAPIST: To know what you want.
CLIENT: Yeah. That doesn’t really happen.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Like, more concretely, you might previously have woken up and said, I want to get this done today. I’m going to get that, I want to have this kind of interaction with that person…
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I want to put this in my… this other thing in my routine. [0:34:02] And then you make most of those things happen, maybe some of them not, and react to all of it.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: But now you kind of draw a blank.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And associated with that sense of (inaudible at 0:24:22) upheaval?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. THERAPIST: Hmm. (Pause) [0:34:58]
CLIENT: From what I remember it wasn’t always, I’m going to go out and do this. It was sometimes like, I’m going to stay here. I’m not going today. This is what I strongly feel [fits me] (ph). It fits what I want right now.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. But either way it was conviction and direction.
CLIENT: Yes. And along with that comes a sort of bolder spirit, which is gone. [And that’s a very big deal, really a bummer] (ph).
THERAPIST: (Crosstalk)
CLIENT: I mean, it comes up. It… I feel like it’s gone…
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But people say that it’s still there. [0:36:00] I mean, where it feels different is here. Where everything feels different is here. I want things clearly here. I’m…
THERAPIST: I see. The lines are drawn clearly here.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Sorry, go ahead.
CLIENT: I’m really committed to not… this not being taken away from me.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: There is such a strong conviction behind that. (Pause) But that isn’t really there for anything else. (Pause) [0:37:00] [0:38:00] [0:39:01] [0:40:00]
THERAPIST: [From what] (ph) you’re describing, you really feel lost. (Pause) [0:41:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, I (inaudible at 0:41:03).
THERAPIST: Yeah, and I guess in a way it seems to me sort of not (ph) all reflected in where your external (ph) life is at, where you are externally. And it’s really like that internally.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t know how what is external would reflect (inaudible at 0:41:42) in a lot more ways than mine does. But external life doesn’t seem compatible with what I feel like internally. [0:42:03] (Pause) It… sometimes it feels in conflict, not always but sometimes. And that’s sort of why I’ve… 
I feel like I’m more drawn to things that make it less in conflict, like meditation (pause) and random other things, like painting, for example, more than (inaudible at 0:42:59). [0:43:02] Sex. Therapy. (Pause) THERAPIST: I think those are things that, for you, are less performative.
<span data-id="P5-N2015C-dsp"></span>

CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:44:00] I’m trying to see if that’s true. (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) [0:45:00]
THERAPIST: And your [experience of it is] (ph) not pushing me or turning the same way I think to seduce me or (inaudible at 0:45:33) that you’re really sad and lost and kind of turned upside down.
CLIENT: [I have lots of] (ph) questions for you…
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: But I don’t know that they’re… I don’t know what it feels like when I’m trying to be seductive or provocative, if it’s just the nature of the question or the tone or if it’s asking questions at all. [0:46:12]
THERAPIST: I’m not saying those are bad things to be. I don’t know if you’re hearing it that way. (Pause)
CLIENT: I think I am hearing it that way.
THERAPIST: Do you know why?
CLIENT: It’s in the context of performativeness, which means bad.
THERAPIST: That’s not how I’m thinking of it. (Pause) [0:47:00] I think there can be something in here and elsewhere that can be kind of defensive about being performative with you. I don’t mean it always is or anything like that, but sometimes it can be like that. But I don’t think it’s bad. It may 
be worried or…
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Whatever (ph), but… (Pause)
CLIENT: I mean, I think it’s… (Pause) [0:47:58] I think you’ve helped me see that actions or situations which feel performative have consequences that feel bad to me or (pause), if I don’t view them as performative, I feel better about them.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So…
THERAPIST: I guess to me (ph) it would seem a bit different, just the last thing you said…
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Which framed it almost as something you could choose to do or not to do if you view it as performative as, I guess, if you don’t, like that. [0:48:57] I guess I imagine wrong then. (Pause) You can sort of let something go of it or feel a little less worried about it and then not feel as pulled 
to try to perform or… (Pause)
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Like my being… I imagine there can be something a bit sort of defensive about the performativeness. But I guess that what you’re saying is it can lead to (inaudible at 0:49:55). [0:50:00] (Pause)
CLIENT: Anyway…
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You weren’t… you were noticing that there was less performance in provoking…
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And not sure if it’s good or bad, if I feel like it’s good or bad, I guess. Maybe I feel like it’s better that way, or maybe it’s just more natural that way to me. (Pause) [0:51:00]
THERAPIST: Was that a question?
CLIENT: (Chuckling) No. (Pause) So a lot of my… a lot of time I spend seeing questions for you come up, and a bunch of them will go away, and a bunch of them (pause) [don’t come out right] (ph). [0:52:02] (Pause) (inaudible at 0:52:23).
THERAPIST: Hmm. (Pause) Well, it’s different things. But sometimes it’s [all sort of wonderful and crucial] (ph). [0:52:55] (Pause)
CLIENT: Why? (Pause)
THERAPIST: Because (pause) someone who’s kind of further along and who you have a connection with can be not necessarily inspiring but can give you a taste of what’s down the road or help you connect within yourself?
<span data-id="P6-N20198-dsp"></span>

CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:53:59] [When did you find] (ph) (inaudible at 0:54:19)?
THERAPIST: Not really that long ago. I (inaudible at 0:54:28), so about a year ago.
CLIENT: What brought you to medicate the first time as a kid? (Pause) There’s not a lot of… there aren’t a lot of kids who turn to medication for something. [0:54:58] To me that says your parents were into it or [someone else was into it] (ph).
THERAPIST: I’m not going to get too much into that stuff, but [I don’t know]. I think it was somewhat related to (inaudible at 0:55:28).
CLIENT: And then [it didn’t even go back to it until a lot later] (ph)?
THERAPIST: No, I practiced for a bunch of years growing up and then stopped.
CLIENT: Did you like [how it affected]…? [0:56:00]
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:56:01)
CLIENT: It’s really hard for me to not (pause) want them to have an impact.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [They were saying about you can lead a spouse to a Christian but you can’t… something like that] (ph).
CLIENT: (Laughing) I don’t know, I haven’t heard that.
THERAPIST: (Chuckling)
CLIENT: Yeah, I just… it feels amazing to have discovered it. [0:57:04] And this feels very strange, to be alone. But it’s seeming more and more like that’s what’s happening.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And I’m not alone, [I’m being left alone] (ph). (Pause) [0:58:00] I’ve noticed that my awareness is… I’ve just now started to notice all these things about my awareness. It’s not very gentle.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: It’s jerky and punitive and fast and (pause) not very graceful or slow or gentle or kind. (Pause) [0:59:00] [1:00:00] I really wanted to have sex with the guy I talked about yesterday. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause) [1:01:00]
CLIENT: I think I’m easily seduced (pause), not just by people but by experiences, too. When certain intense experiences end, I feel the same pain that I feel when [I need people] (ph). (inaudible at 0:01:45). Probably it has something to do with the people involved in the experience, but it’s not like, 
I miss that person, I’m so sad to leave that person… [1:02:02]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. It feels the same as the (inaudible at 0::02:06).
CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 1:02:08) jazz band competition or the afro-beat band I led in college. I still feel a lot of pain having left them. I used to listen to the music and cry (pause) on the subway platform in Los Angeles a couple times. [1:02:59] (inaudible at 1:03:02).
THERAPIST: Why there?
CLIENT: I don’t know.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay. It wasn’t connected to the band in some obvious way?
CLIENT: No, I moved to Los Angeles after I graduated, so that was the place where I was right after I had left the band. So why on the subway platform as opposed to some other (crosstalk)…
THERAPIST: No, I didn’t actually know that you lived in Los Angeles, or I didn’t remember.
CLIENT: I’m 27 years old, I was born in (inaudible at 1:03:40), Kentucky. Then a bunch of other stuff happened, and then I moved to Los Angeles and lived there for a year, and [Jeremy lived] (ph) there for two more years when I moved to Providence. [1:04:04]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And my brother lives there now. So it feels like little parts of my heart have been in Los Angeles all my life.
<span data-id="P7-N201D2-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause)
CLIENT: [What made] you become a doctor? (Pause)
THERAPIST: I didn’t really want to. (Pause) [1:05:00]
CLIENT: But it comes up (inaudible at 1:05:09). (Pause) There are ways in which this seems like… you seem like you share a lot about my life.
THERAPIST: Hmm. [1:06:00] I’m a lot like (inaudible at 1:06:03) somebody, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. Sort of [more palatable] (ph), (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: To think of me that way?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Not that… (Pause) I don’t know. I guess there is something not palatable that… I don’t know. (Pause) [1:06:58] I feel more secure (inaudible at 1:07:05). (Pause) [1:08:00] [1:09:00] [1:10:01] Hello (ph).
THERAPIST: Hey (ph). (Pause)
CLIENT: What is it? (Pause)
THERAPIST: Well… (Pause) [1:10:56] I think for you underneath the kind of very active, directive, sometimes (inaudible at 1:11:02) disorienting, and I think you probably also feel like, when things are pretty much bombarded… and I think (inaudible at 1:11:45) a kind of more active, controlling and directed, 
even performative (inaudible at 1:12:05). [1:12:06] It really helps to pull you together, but… and obviously you bring it up in lots of ways, but it’s… I think there’s also this other stuff.
CLIENT: Uh-huh.
THERAPIST: And… (Pause) [1:13:00] I guess I’m… (Pause) Yeah, I’m not sure what to make of it. I think… (Pause) [1:14:01] Yeah, I don’t understand it in terms of your history really or… I’m not sure what to make of it except to say [it’s like that] (ph). (Pause) And in a way, when you worried a while 
ago about the… breaking down boundaries and getting what you wanted, me (ph),I think part of what you were worried about was inducing in me a state that’s like the kind of confused and disoriented, kind of boundary-less state that we’re talking about in… that I’m talking about, referring to in you, 
that… you were worried that’s kind of like what you’re going to do to me in a way? [1:15:28] I mean, if this wasn’t therapy and it wasn’t kind of playing by the usual rules and I was being sort of thrown off and seduced and too emotional and invested and attracted and… I’d be very discombobulated, unsure 
what I wanted, unsure what’s what. [1:16:00] (Pause)
CLIENT: And that would be bad?
THERAPIST: Well, I think it’s what… part of what you were worried about.
CLIENT: Yeah, I understand (ph) that that would be bad.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: I mean, it would be bad (inaudible at 1:16:44). (Pause) [1:17:00] I think I was worried because it would signal the end of what this is…
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And the start of something (inaudible at 1:17:14)…
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Which would be… also include more internal motivation (ph).
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Right, and I guess it’s… maybe I have the kind of location of it a little bit wrong. But I think it’s that messiness that is actually unfolding but in a different way.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. In me?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) [1:17:58] We got really good (inaudible at 1:18:00). We’re sort of dog-starved? Do you have a dog? Jeremy grew up with dogs his whole life, and Vermont is a pretty spiritual place. Everybody has a spiritual place, but there’s some beautiful things about the state that make it feel 
really nice for growing beings, plants and dogs and chickens (ph) and people. So he grew up with dogs all over the place all the time. And they live in the country. They had a very nice life. [1:18:57] And Jeremy had a pretty special bond with dogs that maybe surpasses, for him, the closeness that he 
feels with humans, probably all humans. And definitely his communication skills definitely… and this is my opinion, are better with dogs than with people (inaudible at 1:19:25).

THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So we are pretty obsessed. We have a long history of loving dogs together. [It’s very rare] (ph). Doing long distance, we would send each other, for the week before (inaudible at 1:19:52) dog countdown. [1:19:57] And the dog countdown was themed in some way? So it would be like, okay, this week’s 
countdown is dogs with flowers. So it would be like, the first week of the countdown, send eight or nine pictures taken off the Internet usually from people’s photo streams in an e-mail. And then the next person would do it the next day, and then the first person would do it the next day. So we did, 
like, 20 of these. And we have this gorgeous painting of all these… I don’t know, we just sort of have a lot invested in how much we love dogs.
So our landlords Morris and Ellen (sp?) had written no pets on the lease. [1:20:57] And we think a lot about getting a dog, and always in the equation is, well, we would probably have to move, or we would have to convince Morris and Ellen. So it came up yesterday, sort of spontaneously. I was describing 
to Ellen how we’re going to Ocean City this weekend for our first anniversary. And we chose a B&amp;B that has two really beautiful dogs, as maybe the second priority out of a lot in what B&amp;B to choose. And I told her [we’re dog-starved] (ph). So then we talked about a bunch of other stuff, and then she 
picked up… she came back to it and said, you guys are dog-starved, and then proceeded to explain her love of dogs and Morris’s love of dogs and explain why they wanted to get a dog, and it just doesn’t work with their travel and this and that. [1:22:05] And so she ended up basically saying, we love 
dogs, we trust you guys, you can get a dog.
THERAPIST: Wow. (Pause)
CLIENT: So I was very visibly touched and happy, and Jeremy was so touched and happy but didn’t really show it that much. Inside we jumped up and down and hugged each other and congratulated each other. And immediately after that I started feeling this sense of fear… really intense fear and dread, cold 
feet. [1:22:59]
THERAPIST: Huh.
CLIENT: And what… and I went to the sitting and to the[ dharma talk] (ph) right after that. I observed it in a more special way maybe than I would have. (Chuckling) And what came up… what I was feeling was, the dog is going to change Jay for me.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: At first it was, oh, change, don’t want it.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Things are… things feel so scary and topsy-turvy already. And I’m coming to a place that I [want to keep working on] (ph), and I don’t want any more change. [1:23:56] But then mostly also what I was feeling was feeling really, this was going to be threatened.
THERAPIST: Huh. (Pause)
CLIENT: Yeah, it’s really confusing.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: This provides… what this provides and what you provide overlap with what a dog would provide. And then, what am I going to do with two of those things? One of them has to be… has to change. Or maybe that would change how we are and how this is. Maybe it would be less important, or maybe I would 
hurt less, or maybe I would care less and maybe would go away. [1:24:58] I would make you go away, or I would feel really differently about you. And that would [make it difficult] (ph). (Pause) [1:26:00] It made me think about, what is the natural course? (Pause)
<span data-id="P9-N20224-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: Of things in general?
CLIENT: I mean, what is the natural course of this, and what is the natural course of dogs in our life? And what’s the natural course of my feelings about both? (Pause) [1:27:00] [1:28:00]
THERAPIST: I’m not sure what to say. (Pause)
CLIENT: I guess that’s disappointing.
THERAPIST: Hmm. (Pause) [1:29:00] Yeah, I don’t have a feel for what the dog thing… what relates the dog thing and… you’re getting a dog and losing me. [1:29:54]
CLIENT: I think everything’s related to everything here. (Pause)
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 1:20:12) a lot of things you’ve said today.
CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much everything. I don’t know what about the dog makes it feel more… more…
THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause)
CLIENT: I think it’s this general theme of, okay, I can’t hold any more things.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. I see.
CLIENT: I can’t be aware of any more things, I can’t hold any more hurt, I can’t hold any more (pause) joy. [1:30:57]
THERAPIST: Yeah, it’s just about too much.
CLIENT: Something, yeah.
THERAPIST: We should stop. (Pause)
CLIENT: I think there’s more (inaudible at 1:31:13).
THERAPIST: Congratulations.
CLIENT: Thanks.
THERAPIST: Happy anniversary, is it?
CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Yeah. It’ll be nice to (inaudible at 1:31:38).
