ABSTRACT / SUMMARY
Client talks about the cathartic affect that automatic writing has on him. He brings up his irritation and anger at the insurance company's refusal to pay for this therapy, at least not as much as he had expected. He's not only upset with the insurance company though, he is also frustrated with the therapist; however, he believes this may be a visceral reaction to his feelings about psychotherapy.
